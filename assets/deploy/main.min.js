There are a bunch of default statuses that can be used (Working form home, Vacationing, Sick, Working Remotely and In a meeting). Setting up a slack status is helpful in addition to personally notifying your team and manager of your status.  Praise publicly, criticise privately  Know the difference between @here and @channel: The @here command lets you grab the attention of team members in a channel who are currently active. The @channel command, on the other hand, will send a message to all team members of the channel, whether they are currently signed in and active or not.  Know when to handle things in person: “Slack can be a useful leveling ground for introverts and extroverts, making it easier to feel heard without getting out of your comfort zone. But when you’re having a discussion with many people at once, sometimes things can get a little confusing, or ideas and opinions can get lost in the shuffle”.  Rather than continuing to go back and forth, quite often the best thing to do is take the conversation offline and regroup with the necessary peopleWhile having a healthy number of channels is good (the more specific and focussed the conversation, the better), it can also be distracting.Good Sidebar Hygiene 🚻  Star channels, groups or DMs and have them instantly rise to the top of the list.  Archive channels that aren’t being used any more. Dead channels are the flotsam and jetsam of the sidebar.  Leave channels if you don’t need to be there. Helps keep things focused.  Group channel names together to be found easily. Here at Slack, we use prefixes like feature_, team_ or product_ to make the channel list quickly siftable.  Make sure your notifications are set at the right level. There’s nothing more daunting than a sidebar with the measles. Vaccinate yourself from that problem by having the bare minimum of notification words, switching your team to using @-mentions for users if mentioning people by name is problematic, and suppressing @channel mentions on a channel by channel basis.  Mute channels if you need to be in a channel, but find it too noisy. You can still be summoned into them with a notification if needs be, but otherwise, shhhhhh, little channel Slack Notification SettingsThe sidebar sweepNow for the powerful magic.In your user menu (top left on desktop), go to Preferences &amp;gt; Advanced Options, and you’ll find this pulldown: Slack Sidebar PreferencesSelect the option for Hiding all channels, groups and DMs with no unread activity for instant peace. Channels will just pop up when someone speaks.If you have and use starred channels, and often want to get to those even when there’s no new activity, choosing Hiding all channels etc., with unread activity, unless they are starred will make everything feel a lot more manageable.  This is a power move, and can get disorienting fast if you’re used to navigating channels with your mouse. The “Quick Switcher” is the fastest way to get around when channels are hidden. Press ⌘+K, (Ctrl+K on windows; or ⌘+T as an alternative in the Mac desktop app) to reach new channels or conversations. Or move back and forth through your channel history with cmd+[ or cmd+] on Mac, alt+left/right arrows on Windows.Tidy up the feedImage and link previews are part of the appeal of Slack, but if you’ve got particularly GIF-happy colleagues or there are a lot of links to wade through then your screen can get very busy very quickly. Type /collapse to hide all image previews in the current channel and /expand to bring them back.There are a host of helpful commands that begin with the slash symbol—just type / in the message field to see them all pop up. Some of them may have been added by the people who set up your Slack channel, and any third-party plug-ins and add-ons will have similar commands of their ownSlack HacksUpdate your Slack status when Google Calendar events beginIf it’s not on Slack, did it really even happen? Use this automation to communicate your status with your team. After you set it up, whenever an event starts in Google Calendar, Zapier will update your status in Slack.

You know, important things such as, “Does anyone have a stapler?” or “Who is free for lunch?”Format messagesLegibility matters, especially when you’re sharing a message that’s long than a sentence or two. If you want to emphasize a certain point, you can *bold it by using asterisks on each side of the word or phrase. You can italicize by using _underscores_ on each side of the word or phrase.You can also make lists within a message. Use the Shift + Enter you create a line break, then number the items or create bullet points with dashes. One of the most unknown formatting tips is that you can create block quotes by using the &amp;gt; symbol and a space before tying your sentenceReference the following syntax:  Emphasis: To create bold text, surround your word or phrase with *asterisks* To italicize text, place _underscores_ around a section.  Strikethrough: To strike out certain words, use ~ to surround the text.  Lists: To create lists, select Shift + Enter to add a new line. To add bullet points, select Opt+8 (Mac) or Alt+0149 (PC).  Blockquotes: To add angle brackets at the start of your message for indents and quotes, type &amp;gt; to indent a single lines or &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to indent multiple paragraphs.  Code blocks: To display a section as inline fixed-width text, use single backticks around the selected area. To create a block of pre-formatted, fixed-width text, use triple backticks.Useful Shortcuts ! ⌨️  Command + , to open preferences  Command + . to expand/collapse the “Flexpane” (right sidebar)  Command + f to search  @ + tab to autocomplete a name  Command + u to upload a file  Shift + Enter to type on a new line  Shift + Command + M to view all of your mentions  Shift + Command + S to view all starred messages  Command + / for all of the keyboard shortcutsSearching Slack “for dummies” 🤦‍♂️One of the great things about Slack is that messages and files are easily searchable. Because channels move so fast, you can use these advanced search commands to pull up exactly what you’re looking for without wasting any time. Advanced Slack SearchChannels and direct messages  in:channelname - Searches only the messages and/or files in a specific channel.  in:name - Searches your direct messages with a specific user.Messages or files from a specific person  from:username - Limits your search to messages from a specific person in any channel or direct message.  from:me - Searches only messages you’ve sent, anywhere in Slack.Links, starred items, and emoji reactions  has:link - Narrows your search to messages that contain a specific URL.  has:star - Pulls messages you’ve starred.  has::emojiname: - Searches messages that contain a specific emoji.Dates and times  before: Use words like “yesterday” or “today.”  after: Use words like “week,” “month,” or “year.”  on: or during: Use specific dates and range keywords, such as “Monday,” “February,” or “2016.”  Pro tip: To use very specific dates, use the MM/DD/YYYY (United States) or YYYY/MM/DD (International) format.)For more on searching in Slack, check out this resource.Terminilogies  Backscroll: The chat history of a channel. Reading through the history is referred to as “backscrolling”  Channel: A public place to chat.  Group: A private channel between 2 or more people. People can be invited and can leave groups.  DM: A private chat between two people, short for “direct message”. You can start group DMs, but those are discouraged see Use Private Groups Not Group DMsNaming GuidelinesBroad channelsStart with the basics and add new channels around major topics:  departments (e.g. #design, #marketing, #sales, #finance, etc.)  office locations (e.g. #loc_london, #loc_sf, etc.)Individual channels for regional offices or project teams are a great way to share relevant information and start conversations with the right people.Specific channelsNext, consider using a set of standard prefixes to keep channel names organized and descriptive. Here are a few of our favorites:PatternDescriptiondev_Ask questions or find information about engineering topics. Example: #dev_general, #dev_status  sales_Ask questions or find information about sales topics. Example: #sales_general, #sales_ideas  cs_Ask questions or find information about customer success topics. Example: #cs_general, #cs_ideas  marketing_Ask questions or find information about marketing topics. Example: #marketing_general, #marketing_ideas  team_A place for groups to coordinate team-related topics and activities. Example: #team_DISCO, #team_enigma  wg_A place foe workgroups to coordinate around certain specific issues Example: #wg_facebook, #wg_teamwiki  feature_ or project_For cross-functional teams working together.  Example: #feature_integrations #project_bathtub  The main difference between a feature and project channels is that usually feature are long term product features while projects can be temporary exploration or a short-term featureRelevant Readings  Everything You Are Afraid To Ask About Slack Etiquette  Slack Tips for Beginners: Productivity and Etiquette",url:"/posts/Slack-etiquette-and-hacks/",date:"2017-10-14 00:00:00 +0100"}},{3:{id:"3",title:"Creating A First Data Science Team",image:"images/posts/shell.jpg",category:"general",content:"There are three broad types of companies that put AI at the core of their value chain:  R&amp;amp;D companies: Similar to pure academic research, these companies aim to further the field of artificial intelligence, often without a specific product or application in mind. Examples are non-profit organizations, think tanks or investor backed R&amp;amp;D companies.  AI Champion: These companies put AI at the core of their value creation. While they do invest heavily in research and development, their research efforts are focused on developing a product that fully exploits the capabilities of AI for a specific application.  Digital Enterprise: These companies use AI as a competitive advantage and improve their own value chain but the development of AI itself is not part of their core product.  In these organisations AI-based solutions are used to solve a real need.Digital enterprises can build up in-house competences and grow a team that focuses on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. A dedicated AI team has a higher chance of attracting AI talent and maintaining standards than a single gift card division does. Ideally, indeed, the team would be supervised by a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAiO)/Chief Data offices (CD)) (whatever you want to call it) who pushes digital innovation from the perspective of the senior management.  AI itself is not a product or a business. Rather, it is a foundational technology that can help existing lines of business and create new products or lines of business. The ability to understand and work with diverse business units or functional teams is therefore critical ..Roles .. whats what ?Data Scientist (DS)A data scientist is the alchemist of the 21st century: someone who can turn raw data into purified insights. Data scientists apply statistics, machine learning and analytic approaches to solve critical business problems. Their primary function is to help organizations turn their volumes of big data into valuable and actionable insights.The problem-solving skills of a data scientist requires an understanding of traditional and new data analysis methods to build statistical models or discover patterns in data. For example, creating a recommendation engine, predicting the stock market, diagnosing patients based on their similarity, or finding the patterns of fraudulent transactions.They should have experience working with different datasets of different sizes and shapes, and be able to run his algorithms on large size data effectively and efficiently, which typically means staying up-to-date with all the latest cutting-edge technologies. This is why it is essential to know computer science fundamentals and programming, including experience with languages and database (big/small) technologies.Skills: Python, R, Scala, Apache Spark, Hadoop, machine learning, deep learning, and statisticsTools: Data Science Experience, Jupyter, and RStudioData Engineer (DE)Data Engineers are the data professionals who prepare the “big data” infrastructure to be analyzed by Data Scientists. They are software engineers who design, build, integrate data from various resources, and manage big data. Then, they write complex queries on that, make sure it is easily accessible, works smoothly, and their goal is optimizing the performance of their company’s big data ecosystem.They might also run some ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) on top of big datasets and create big data warehouses that can be used for reporting or analysis by data scientists. Beyond that, because Data Engineers focus more on the design and architecture, they are typically not expected to know any machine learning or analytics for big data.Skills: Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, Data streaming, NoSQL, SQL, Distributed ProgrammingTools: MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Kafka .. etcMachine Learning Engineer (MLE)An extension of the Data Engineer but with more focus and experience on Machine Learning algorithms and problems. Ideally an ML engineer will have knowledge in:  Radial Basis Support Vector Machine  Boosted Trees  Random Forest  Lasso / Ridge Regression / Elastic Net  K-Nearest Neighbors  Neural Networks Deep Belief Nets or Stacked Denoising AutoencodersConvolutional Neural NetsLong Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent netsRecursive Neural Nets  Word2vec and related algorithms for learning words from their contextProduct Manager (PM)Product management is about taking business requirements and converting it into actual product. If you look at the pipeline mentioned above, data engineers are good at coding, data scientists are good at statistics and algorithms. However what is missing in this picture is a role that understands the business requirements, knows what to look for in the data based on the business goals, and translates it to data scientist. DS then comes up with an algorithm that can be used and then the PM takes the pipeline feature to the engineer who tweaks the pipeline to start recording the new data as requested by the scientist.DS, PM, and DE are the three pillars of data analytics in a firm and they work closely together to track meaningful metrics, analyze them and then utilize the insights to improve KPI for the actual consumer product.So PM (data) is a product manager of the data analytics pipeline/data science pipeline. Its a newer role targeted at companies which have lots of data to analyze and make impact on the business goals/KPIs.A PM (data) needs to know statistics, machine learning and AI algorithms (at least cursorily), have good product sense, be good in handling numbers/metrics/identifying KPI’s, be good in communication, knows how to code (expected to code hands on anywhere in the pipeline to make a tweak or two), and should have some knowledge of big data technologies/software such as AWS ecosystem (EMR, Spark, Redshift)The table of expectationsThe table below shows the varied skills, responsibilities and behaviours expected from all the roles across the different experience levelsSkillsLevelSkills scopeProgrammingComputer ScienceScientific MethodLegislationsLeadExpertise in multiple frameworks and tools with hands on practical experience in applying data science and ML in large-scale production environmentsHave the ability to proficiently program in multiple languages and have solid working knowledge across multiple databases of various paradigms (relational, K/V, graph)Have solid understanding of various CS concepts and is well versed in data structures and algorithms/complexity analysisAble to quickly decide what is the best method/algorithm to use for various situationsDetailed knowledge in data protection and privacy laws  SeniorExpertise in multiple frameworks and tools with experience in applying data science and ML in large-scale production environmentsHave the ability to program in multiple languages and have working knowledge across multiple databases of various paradigms (relational, K/V, graph)Have solid understanding of various CS concepts and is well versed in data structures and algorithms/complexity analysisCan decide quickly the best methods/algorithms to use for an increased set of problemsIncreased Knowledge in data protection and privacy laws and legislations  MidIncreased technical skills within multiple tools and programming languages for each corresponding job titleSkills in various programming languages and frameworks that correspond to each job titleHave good knowledge in various CS concepts/data structures and algorithms/complexity analysisAble to quickly decide what is the best method/algorithm to use for various situationsKnowledge in data protection and privacy laws and legislations  JuniorTechnical skill within one of the skills required for each role in the corresponding job titleProficient in at least one programming language related to the job titleKnowledge in various CS concepts/ data structures and algorithms/complexity analysisIs able to assess various alternatives and be able to select the best choice of tool/algorithm according to scientific methodsN/AResponsibilitiesLevelScopeComplexityPlanningProduction SupportReportingLeadLeads complex projects &amp;amp; programsWorks on projects that span a range of business areasLeads project planning.

Her job is to clearly articulate the business value to the product team so they understand the intent behind the new product or product release. She owns the strategy behind the product and its roadmap and must work with engineering to build what matters.The engineering manager defines and drives technical strategy and architectural vision for the product and sometimes the company. He is responsible for defining the development methodology and ensuring adoption across the engineering team and organization. The engineering manager designs appropriate solutions and recommends alternative approaches, when necessary.  The product manager owns the product roadmap. He is the person responsible for defining, in detail, the “why’”and high-level “what” of the product that the engineering team will be asked to buildProduct Expert vs. Technical ExpertThe product manager is the go-to product expert on the team. He facilitates communication between the team and the stakeholders and ensures that the team is building the right product at the right time. He is also is a key resource to the rest of the non-technical organization and should be responsible for the overall success of the entire product experience. He must be the master of the product.The engineering manager serves as a technical lead for technical decisions and he must stay abreast of advancements in related technologies. He manages complex technical projects and a team of engineers. In many environments, the engineering manager is willing to roll up his sleeves and code alongside his team while guiding the engineering team to grow both technically and professionally. He leads the planning, execution, and success of complex technical projects while recommending engineering best practices and assessing feasibility and ramifications of new business requirements.Manage Indirectly vs. Manage DirectlyThe product manager is typically seen as the CEO of the product, even though no one reports directly to her. For the product manager, this means she is responsible for making product decisions and must motivate and lead a cross-functional team of leaders from across the organization. She is responsible for delivering an entire product experience and ensuring the company can market, sell, and support it.The engineering manager must not only have technical chops but also directly manage a team of engineers. The engineering manager is responsible for supporting the professional goals and development opportunities for the entire engineering staff — including providing coaching and mentoring, one-on-one meetings and reviewing each engineer’s progress.  A great engineering manager delivers against project goals, contributes to (but does not own) product strategy and helps develop his teamA great product manager leads the product vision and roadmap while helping a cross-functional team be great. Working together, the product and engineering managers can create a product planning and development environment for success.The future is bright 🔆Having identified the various paths one can take in the data team .. it is vital to understand that as we grow, we will be forming sub-teams inside of this team. Each team will be specialised in a specific area (Business Intelligence, Data Science, Data Engineering, etc.)Each team will have a Head/Director who will be responsible for a group of product managers and engineers (on all levels) as see fitThe figure below shows a potential future of how this team can be and where can people grow into 🌲",url:"/posts/creating-data-science-team/",date:"2017-09-22 00:00:00 +0100"}},{4:{id:"4",title:"LaTeX Best Practices",image:"/images/posts/phd.png",category:"general",content:"Completing a PhD can be a hell of a task. It took me lots of time to be able to come up with a framework that optimises how i do research and how i write and publish my research. This post discusses some of the tools and techniques i used in addition to LaTEX best practices. These are gathered either by experience, online search and most importantly the wisdom of my PhD supervisor @Raphael Troncy.I hope this post can help you complete your PhD smoothly.  You can head to my PhD Github repository to see all my LaTEX recommendations in actionMendeley and Bibliography ManagementDoing effective and genuine research requires that you familiarise yourself with the state of the art in your field. This requires reading tons of journal, conference and workshop papers. However, after some time, recalling what you have read and being able to effectively reference that in your research becomes a daunting task.I personally found Mendeley a great tool to arrange my bibliography. It has loads of features, but i have used it mainly to arrange my digital research library. I have used Mendeley basically as follows:  As i did not have a specific research topic in the beginning, i was skimming various wide fields. As a result, i have created a separate folder for each research field i was focusing on e.g., Dataset Profiling, Linked Data quality  I had a root folder for conferences, journals and workshops that contained a separate folder for each relevant venue for my research. For example, i had:  I also had a separate folder foe even paper i have made. That folder contained all the papers i have read that influenced my research for that paper and/or have been referenced in it.├── Conferences ├── ISWC&#39;13 - International Semantic Web conference 2013 ├── ESWC&#39;13 - Extended Semantic Web conference 2013├── Workshops\t├── PROFILES&#39;15 - International Workshop on Dataset PROFIling and fEderated Search for Linked Data├── Posters ├── Semantic Web Journal ├── IJSWIS - International Journal on Semantic Web and Information SystemsGeneral Organisations  Create a structure to include your papers in an organised fashion. I keep separate folders for papers, posters, presentations, reports and thesis. Note: Demo and research paper are included in the same folder, you can decide to have posters and demo in the same folder. It is up to you.  To easily navigate through papers, it is good to have a separate folder for each conference (if you a large number of papers, and then from there you have another hierarchy with the year) but for me it is a flat structure inside each folder with a naming convention that follows &amp;lt;Conference&amp;gt;&#39;&amp;lt;Year&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;Paper Name&amp;gt;.  Keep a util folder in the root. This will help misc files that you need globally. For me, i have a LaTeX folder inside that includes all the document classes that i use across my papers. I then reference the class using relative path. This way, you will need to maintain different copies of the same files in each paper’s folder. Also this folder will include a Bibliography folder containing a centralised .bib file. I will come to this in details after.  In every paper folder, create a separate folder for your figures to include shapes, graphics and charts and tables to include .xls, .csv, .lyx files or any information related to creating tables.An Example of my folders structure├── Papers│├── ESWC&#39;13 - SNARC A Semantic Social News Aggregator││├── figures││└── presentation│├── IJSWIS - Towards An Objective Assessment Framework for Linked Data Quality││├── figures││└── tables│├── PROFILES&#39;15 - An Extensible Framework to Validate and Build Dataset Profiles││└── figures├── Posters│├── ESWC&#39;14 - What are the Important Properties of an Entity - Comparing Users and Knowledge Graph Point of View││└── poster│└── WWW&#39;15 - Observing The State of Linked Open Data Cloud Metadata│ └── figures├── Presentations├── Progress Reports CIFRE &amp;amp; Workplans│├── CIFRE Activity Reports│├── Conferences Attestations│├── EDITE Progress Reports│├── EURECOM PhD Scientific Council││├── EURECOM PhD Day 2013││└── EURECOM PhD Day 2014│└── PhD Interim Report│ ├── figures│ └── presentation└── Util ├── Bibliography └── LaTEXSpecial OrganisationFor special reports (or thesis), when you have multiple .tex files and things can get messy then you can:  Create separate folder for each section (introduction, abstract, etc.). Each directory contain all the LaTeX code, and could have further subdirectories if required. All .tex files are included in the paper by adding input{directory/subdirectory/something.tex} to your main .tex file in the appropriate place.  The Util folder in this case will include additional files: All package inclusions usepackage{}, command declarations, etc. required for the paper are included in include.texFormatting and special stylings are included in format.tex file.├── Thesis│├── Part1││└── Chapter1│├── abstract│├── acknowledgement│├── acronyms│├── appendix│├── background│├── conclusions│├── introduction│└── util│ └── figures  └── include.tex  └── format.texEnvironment Setup  I cannot stress enough on the importance of using a versioning system like git or svn. It is vital for collaborative authoring.  My development machine is a Mac running OSX Yosemite. I use MacTEX. MacTex is an all-in-one package installing the following: GUI Applications: TeXShop , BibDesk, LaTeXiT, TeX Live Utility, the spell checker Excalibur, and some documentationGhostscript 9.10TeX Live 2014, the actual TeX distributionGenerating LaTeX Tables  A nice program that provides a GUI for various tasks is Lyx. I have not used it for Mac but it was useful when editing/creating tables on Windows. It can import data in .csv format and generate .tex code from it.  There is several online .tex generators. I use the online LaTeX table generator, and found it very useful for small/medium tables.  There is a handy Excel script to convert tables in Excel files to LaTeX. You can find it in Util/Excel To LaTeX Table Converter.xlaEditing LaTeX with Sublime TextI use Sublime Text for nearly everything, so using it to write LaTeX was the logical choice for me. With the correct plugins it is a handy editor. You first need to make sure you have a valid TeX distribution (see above) and installed Skim PDF Viewer. Skim is used to generate the result of the LaTeX build.Assuming you already have package control installed install the LaTeX Tools package. Now, after editing a LaTeX document, simply hit cmd+b to build the file and launch it in Skim.Note Make sure you have the build settings in Sublime Text set to automatic [tools -&amp;gt; Build Systems].Now you will be able to use latex in Sublime. A powerful feature is auto-completion for references and citations, just start typing cite{ or ref{ and you will get the list of targets in a dropdown list (where you can also filter) to select from.LaTeX Writing Tips  Use as few packages as possible. That’s because packages tend to conflict and go obsolete check this  Call the packages in particular order. Some packages require (or are recommended) to be called before/after other packages. Some must be called among the last, some among the first.  Use comment blocks to identify each section  Use labels always to refer to sections, figures or tables. Start your label for each with a unique string e.g. fig:, sec:, tab:. This is useful when the auto-complete suggests several entries, you can easily filter and find what you want exactly.  Always use url command to represent URLs.  Use ~ to have a space between the last work and the reference or citation e.g. in~cite{}  In your LaTeX document, avoid as much as possible to control the layout. Hence, you should never use  Either you want to start a new paragraph or you don’t but you should let LaTeX format the paper.Writing-Style Tips  When writing, try to use as much as possible the present tense (as opposed to the past tense). Most of the things you’re writing are still true, so why using the past tense? This, generally, makes sentences which are much more complicated and hard to read.Working with Citations and .bib filesI used to have a separate .bib file for each paper. However, i ended up using a bunch of the same references in more than one paper. I thought of why not having a centralised .bib file where i can maintain and then reference this file from all my other papers. The idea is:  There is a central .bib file containing just about every reference you (or your coauthors) have ever even thought of.  You (and your various coauthors) have a variety of documents that refer to stuff in this central .bib file.  You want to look in the .aux file for a list of references, then go to this .bib file, extracts the relevant entries, and then puts them in a local .bbl file ready for insertion in to the document for each paper.This is done automatically by BibTex. So for me, in every paper now i only add bibliography{../../Util/Bibliography/bibliography} and i am good to go.Maintaining a clean .bib fileI used to copy/paste BibTex citations from the Internet and though that i am good to go. However, the information copied is very noisy and contains lots of unneeded information. The best practice is to check what are the required information for each bib entry and include only that. For example, for the @inproceedings you need to have [title, author, year, booktitle]. In addition make sure to:  Escape the accents and special characters in people names  Try to always write “firstName lastName” and not “lastName, firstName” or an initial for the firstName or whatever … all this is decided by the bib style (e.g. a .bst file). Use the “and” operator between authors and not the comma.  Include the title between double curly braces. This way the capitalisation will be respected as you write. Otherwise, all words will be lower case, including acronyms, etc. Don’t write a final dot in the title, the style will add one already.  Have a consistent way of naming the bib entry. Choose whatever you like, for example i chose: &amp;lt;Main_author_LastName&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;Conference/Venue&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;Year&amp;gt; where the year is in two digits representation, e.g. Assaf:ESWC:13  For inproceedings just write the conference name, and do not include the address, or month, or even the word Proceedings since the style might display it as well and you don’t want to read “Proceedings of Proceedings of …”  If you write a URL, anywhere, then say it’s a url using the url command.  Don’t write journal abbreviation, or conference abbreviation, again the style can do this.  If you use the article element, then specify the volume and number.

However, I am aware of how much easier to use Wordpress is for lots of users. If we want to compare Wordpress’ workflow to that of a static site: even though making changes to my Jekyll site may seem rather easy to me, it really isn’t that straightforward:  Write a post in Markdown  Commit changes to GitHub  Build the site on my local machine  Manually transfer the changed files to the serverAlthough i have moved huge hidden parts like compressing images and compressing files and HTML to grunt tasks, there are still of steps needed to easily deploy an changes locally to the live server.Another problem with this workflow is that the GitHub repo sometimes wouldn’t be up to date with the content I was serving, or vice versa, because had to make shortcuts here and there (edit content directly on live server, push a change locally but forget to deploy that live and so on). Basically, you want the code on GitHub to actually represent what you are serving.All of the above have led me to set up automatic deployments to my server. This means that my workflow now just consists of creating content and committing it — the rest is done automatically. Travis CI builds the site, compresses assets, runs a few tests, and deploys it all to DigitalOcean, where a web server (Apache, Nginx) serves it.Failed experimentsI have my Jekyll instance running on a Digital Ocean Droplet, to configure one, you can easily follow their great tutorial.Jekyll website has nice articles on continuous integration and Deployment. In a nutshell, serving Jekyll can be done in two ways:  It is a static website, so just have a web server like Apache running and point that to the _site  Run the jekyll serve process on your server and proxy your web server e.g., Apache to point to your http://0.0.0.0:4000  Setting 0.0.0.0 as an address to serve from is a way of saying to match all network interfaces on the machine. So if your local IP was 192.168.0.1 it would serve on both 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.1, computers on your local network would have access to your jekyll site. By doing jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0 you make sure the website is accessible externally properly.To enable those two scenarios, i used Codeship’s deployment pipeline that will make sure to pull the latest changes on the website and its submodules whenever a push is triggered on Github. I did that by having this line:ssh -p $SSH-PORT-NUMBER root@SERVER-ADDRESS &#39;cd /www/blog; git pull origin master; git submodule foreach git pull origin master&#39;Where as you substitute the location of your github repo in the server to point correctly, e.g., /www/blog.Now, after that you can have a git post-receive or post-merge hook that will run the appropriate grunt task e.g., grunt serve or if you running using tmux for example and a jekyll serve process is already running, then it will pick up the change automatically and your changes will be reflected automatically.Both files must have the correct permission and are executable:#!/bin/bashecho &quot;Running Git Post Merge Hooks&quot;cd /var/www/blog &amp;amp;&amp;amp; grunt buildThe only thing i’d like to note if you are using the jekyll serve approach is that you will need to tell your webserver to proxy requests to jekyll’s instance. To do that, you will need to edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf file as follows:&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:*&amp;gt; ProxyPreserveHost On # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName # specifies what hostname must appear in the request&#39;s Host: header to # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless. # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly. #ServerName www.example.com ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost DocumentRoot /www/blog # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn, # error, crit, alert, emerg. # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular # modules, e.g. #LogLevel info ssl:warn ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ProxyPass / http://0.0.0.0:4000/ ProxyPassReverse / http://0.0.0.0:4000/ ServerName localhost # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only # after it has been globally disabled with &quot;a2disconf&quot;. #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;For various reason that i am still not sure what, this process failed to me as the website was not updating as i was pushing changes. For example, when i push to Github, the build triggers and the build is successful and is able to pull the latest for the main repo and the submodule but the git hooks seem to never be fired. However, I have tried to pull manually from the repo and indeed the hooks were triggered then.What i tried as well was creating a new script called deploy.sh which will be called as well as part of the codeship custom script so that the script is:ssh -root@SERVER &#39;cd /var/www/blog; npm install; git pull origin master; git submodule foreach git pull origin master; bash /var/www/blog/deploy.sh&#39;And the deploy.sh has the correct permissions and is:#!/usr/bin/bashgrunt build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo &quot;blog deployed via hook on: `git log -1`&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; deployment.txtWhere the file deployment.txt will contain a log of the latest commit messages that were deployed. Again, this method failed as well.I have tried to add a remote in my web server called production so that i can push directly to my server with git push production master .. the data is pushed indeed but i still dont get the hooks to be run at all.As a result of my failed attempts, i had to try another approach and i decided to go and try TravisCI.Going the Travis way Continuous Deployment &amp;amp; Integration with Travis CI  Image Reference: Website Continuous Integration with Travis CI, Jekyll, gulp, and GitHubThe first step to achieving this new workflow was to have rigorous rules set up on the server. No more deployments as root, from now on we’re doing things correctly.Setting up the serverCreate a new user with restricted accessWe need to create a new user with limited permissions: the user will be only allowed to operate in the destination where you have blog in the server e.g., /var/www/blog. This new user will also be used by Travis CI to log in, and we’ll give it ownership of our live directory.$ adduser travis$ chown -R travis:travis /var/www/blogSet up public key authenticationFor Travis CI to log in to the server, we’ll set up public key authentication. To do this, on your local machine, you should run:ssh-keygenWhich should output something like this:Generating public/private rsa key pair.Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/USNER_NAME/.ssh/id_rsa): deploy-keyIt will also ask for a passphrase; leave that blank. This process should leave you with two files in your .ssh folder: deploy-key, which is your private key (this is like a password, so protect it at all times!) and deploy-key.pub, your public key.Now your server needs to know your public key for the correct user so that you can log in using your private key. SSH to your live server and:$ su - travisThen, we’ll create a .ssh directory in the home directory, and an authorized_keys file inside of it:$ mkdir .ssh$ chmod 700 .ssh$ vi .ssh/authorized_keysAt this point, you can paste in the contents of your deploy-key.pub file. Now, we’ll just restrict the permissions to the authorized_keys file:$ chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keysCreate a remoteWe want now to be able to push to our server the same how we push to Github. Now, to understand how we will structure our folders, we need to remember how Jekyll compiles and generates our site. Basically, Jekyll will build based on your template and configurations the final “static” version of the website and have that in the _site folder. This means that what you should be serving is only that folder and we really don’t care about all the other stuff.I have created a separate hidden folder called .build which will contain all the site to build. I then create a subfolder for each remote repository. For example, for my blog i have created an empty Git repo in it mkdir /var/www/.build/blog and then initialize the git repo there with cd /var/www/.build/blog &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git init --bare.We need to make sure that we have correct access permissions and ownership for our repositories.chown -R travis /var/www/.build/Now we need to add a post-receive hook, which is a list of commands to run once the remote has received a push:$ cd hooks$ vi post-receiveNow, i need to tell Git where to find my main _site or the content that will be served live. For me, i have set up my server to serve my content from var/www/blog. So, in my git hook i have:#!/bin/shgit --work-tree=/var/www/blog --git-dir=/var/www/.build/blog checkout -fThe post-receive hook will just need to be executable, so that it actually can do its job:$ chmod +x post-receiveSetting up Travis CIEverything now is ready for Travis to start doing its magic. However, we have a slight problem of granting Travis access to the private key. If our Github repo is private this can be a solution although this is definitely not a recommended approach.It turns out that Travis has a command-line utility to encrypt files. Using this, it’s safe to upload the key publicly to GitHub, and Travis CI can still use it. You’ll need to log in first though, because it will have to add two private environment variables to your Travis account, so that it can decrypt the encrypted private key later on (yeah, we’re getting into some pretty heavy crypto setups now, but it’s the best we can do).Travis executes commands based on instructions defined in .travis.yml file. We need to create such a file in your repository:touch .travis.ymlYou’ll need to copy your private key file (deploy-key) to your local repository. Then, we’ll install the Travis command line utility, log in, and encrypt the file:gem install travistravis logintravis encrypt-file deploy-key --addThe last command will create an encrypted copy of your deployment key, deploy-key.enc. It will also add a few lines to your .travis.ymlbefore_install:  - openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_22009518e18d_key -iv $encrypted_22009518e18d_iv -in deploy-key.enc -out deploy-key -d  You should immediately remove the unencrypted private key from your repo, so that you don’t risk uploading it to GitHub. There are bots out there that do nothing but analyze GitHub commits to find login information, and they will compromise your server in a matter of seconds if you accidentally disclose the key.Instructing Travis with .travis.ymlAll we need to do now is to tell Travis how to build, test and deploy the site. For that purpose, we have the .travis.yml, which acts as a list of instructions for Travis.Right now, my .travis.yml file looks like this:language: rubycache:  bundler: true  directories:  - node_modulesrvm:- 2.2env:  global:  - NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=trueaddons:  ssh_known_hosts:  - &amp;lt;SERVER_IP_ADDRESS&amp;gt;  - &amp;lt;SERVER_IP_ADDRESS&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;SERVER_PORT_NUMBER&amp;gt;sudo: falsebefore_install:- bundle install- nvm install 4.2.2- nvm use 4.2.2- npm install grunt-cli -g- npm install- bash _scripts/install.shbefore_script:- echo -e &quot;Host &amp;lt;SERVER_IP_ADDRESS&amp;gt;ntStrictHostKeyChecking non&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.ssh/config- echo -e &quot;Host &amp;lt;SERVER_IP_ADDRESS&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;SERVER_PORT_NUMBER&amp;gt;ntStrictHostKeyChecking non&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.ssh/configscript:- bash _scripts/build.sh- bash _scripts/test.shafter_success:- bash _scripts/deploy.shnotifications:  slack: &amp;lt;SLACK_CHANNEL&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;TOKEN&amp;gt;  Note that i have masked various things like server address and slack token for security reasons. The variables &amp;lt;SERVER_IP_ADDRESS&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;SERVER_PORT_NUMBER&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;SLACK_CHANNEL&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;TOKEN&amp;gt; have to be filled with your specific detailsThere are various configurations that we can set up to customize the build. Our configuration file defines Ruby as the main language, and version 2.2 as the version that should be installed on Travis with rvm.We define as well what files and folders to cache. This is of great important as it speeds up our build significantly. Caches lets Travis CI store directories between builds, which is useful for storing dependencies that take longer to compile or download. For us, we cache the dependencies for Jekyll with bundler and all of our node_modules as well.We also add our server IP address as well as our SSH IP address (i did this as i have a different SSH port number that the default one) as known hosts so that I don’t get a warning when I try to connect to it.I reference a few bash scripts to run at various stages of the build process. These scripts have been placed in the _scripts directory, which won’t be built by Jekyll since its name starts with an underscore.before_installBefore starting any of the process we need to make sure that we have set up our environment by installing nvm, Node.js and all of our global npm modules and gem files. Necessary files and folders will be brought up from the cache when needed. Afterwards, we execute the install.sh file which contains:#!/bin/bashset -x # Show the output of the following commands (useful for debugging)# Import the SSH deployment keyopenssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_7bbee2d42c21_key -iv $encrypted_7bbee2d42c21_iv -in deploy-key.enc -out deploy-key -drm deploy-key.enc # Don&#39;t need it anymorechmod 600 deploy-keymv deploy-key ~/.ssh/id_rsaThe openssl command decrypts the encrypted private key.  I’ve actually just copy-pasted what travis encrypt-file added to .travis.yml earlier on.Also, note that I’m moving the key to the .ssh directory under the name id_rsa. This is the default name for the key Git will look for when pushing to the server. It makes our lives a bit easier to place it there, under that name, since we won’t need to specify what key should be used later on.before_scriptA common problem i hit when trying to connect with SSH to my server was having SSH read properly from the known_hosts whenever i try to connect. However, there seemed to be a problem that i could not wrap my head around until i came across this article. As a result, i disable StrictHostKeyChecking to enable Travis to log in properly with these two commands.buildThe build is straightforward for me as i have everything configured in Grunt. My build.sh file looks like:#!/bin/bashset -x# Build the site with Jekyllgrunt buildtestTesting is done with HTML-Proofer. Since it is in my Gemfile, Travis automatically installs it for us. My test file is configured as:#!/bin/bashset -xbundle exec htmlproofer _site --url-ignore &quot;/ahmadassaf.com|github.com/&quot; --only-4xx --http-status-ignore &quot;403&quot; --check-html --check-faviconIn this one command, I’m validating HTML, checking that no external link returns a 400-error (ignoring any redirects as they are fine), and that the favicon is present and referenced on every page. I ignore my blog address url and Github’s with _site --url-ignore &quot;/ahmadassaf.com|github.com/&quot; as whenever you’re adding a new post, it’ll return an error because the post isn’t online yet (i do that also for Github as i link as well the posts to my Github repository).deployAt this point, we want to deploy what we’ve just built. That’s why we’re going to push from a new repo in our _site folder.#!/bin/bashset -x# Initialize a new git repo in _site, and push it to our server.cd _sitegit initgit remote add deploy &quot;ssh://travis@&amp;lt;IP_ADDRESS&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;PORT_NUMBER&amp;gt;/var/www/.build/blog&quot;git config user.name &quot;Travis CI&quot;git config user.email &quot;ahmad.a.assaf+travisCI@gmail.com&quot;git add .git commit -m &quot;Deploy&quot;git push --force deploy masterWe’re adding our remote with the deployment username that we have configured earlier, on the path where our .git directory is. We commit everything and push it using the --force. This is necessary, since this new repo isn’t strictly linked to our remote; it doesn’t have the same history or anything. This argument just tells Git to ignore that fact.Feel free to ask or check out my GitHub repo to check how everything is set up in action !Relevant References  Website Continuous Integration with Travis CI, Jekyll, gulp, and GitHub  Travis CI deployments to DigitalOcean  How To Set Up Apache Virtual Hosts on Ubuntu",url:"/posts/enabling-continuous-deployment-for-jekyll/",date:"2016-12-03 00:00:00 +0000"}},{7:{id:"7",title:"Auditing NPM Modules in Microservices",image:"/images/posts/npm.png",category:"web development",content:"Where i work at Beamery we follow Microservices Architecture and have a good 20+ git repositories. With time, these repos become bloated with old NPM modules that are either outdated or not used anymore at all. I wanted to find a way to easily audit and clean this mess.I came across the great npm-check that:  Tells you what’s out of date.  Provides a link to the package’s documentation so you can decide if you want the update.  Kindly informs you if a dependency is not being used in your code.  Works on your globally installed packages too, via -g.  Interactive Update for less typing and fewer typos, via -u.  Supports public and private @scoped/packages.  Supports ES6-style import from syntax.  Upgrades your modules using your installed version of npm, including the new npm@3, so dependencies go where you expect them.  Works with any public npm registry, private registries, and alternate registries like Sinopia.  Does not query registries for packages with private: true in their package.json.  Emoji in a command-line app, because command-line apps can be fun too.  Works with npm@2 and npm@3, as well as newer alternative installers like ied and pnpm.To automate running npm-check across all of our repos and generate one coherent report, i created a simple bash-it plugin. The plugin in its core does:# Generate NPM report using the npm-check module to inspect the state of our npm modules# The function will check if npm-check is installed and install it otherwise# The report will be generated in the root directory and will be called npm-report.txtgenerate_npm_report() { if command_exists npm-check ; then  find . -maxdepth 1 -type d ( ! -name . ) -exec bash -c &quot;cd &#39;{}&#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; printf &#39;Examining NPM modules for &#39;{}&#39;&#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo &#39;{}&#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ../npm-report.txt &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm-check &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ../npm-report.txt&quot; ; else  printf &#39;npm-check module was not found.

This generated a list of all my NPM modules used and their respective count.Cleaning out unused NPM modulesThe previous function is good at giving us an idea of what modules are being used and in what frequency. However, we might have a bunch of unused modules that were left over old code and will just increase the size of our containers with no actual use.We can easily clean out those modules by taking advantage of the npm-clean and plug that in a similar wrapper as the function above:# Clean unused NPM modules from each repository# The function will check if npm-clean is installed and install it otherwiseclean_npm_modules() { if command_exists npm-clean ; then  find . -maxdepth 1 -type d ( ! -name . ) -exec bash -c &quot;cd &#39;{}&#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; printf &#39;Cleaning NPM modules for &#39;{}&#39;&#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo &#39;{}&#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ../npm-clean-report.txt &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm-clean &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ../npm-clean-report.txt&quot; ; else  printf &#39;npm-check module was not found.

Another reason to move away from WordPress was the need to have a collaborative effort and to write posts in Markdown. I have finally decided on Jekyll for its simplicity and extensibility.Jekyll takes your content written in Markdown, passes it through your templates and spits it out as a complete static website, ready to be served. Jekyll is a static site generator in contrast to Wordpress.In dynamic websites as in the case of Wordpress, when a visitor gets to a website, a server-side script will query one or multiple databases to get the content for the requested page. The server-side script will then pass the results to a templating engine that will format and arrange everything properly and generate an HTML file for the user to consume. This is a heavy task, although you can optimize that with various caching mechanisms. This concept makes sense for content that changes often, thus the name “dynamic”.The proposition of a static site is to shift the heavy load from the moment visitors request the content to the moment content actually changes. When a visitor requests a page, the content is already rendered and ready to be served instantly as the build process had been already executed at the build stage offline. In the case of a blog (or at least my blog), after the post is written, it is rarely changed except when major content updates are needed.This means that whenever a content is changed, the whole site has to be rebuilt. For small sites, the build time is minimal. However, for larger ones, the build time can be about 10 times as long. The build time depends on a number of factors, such as the number of loops and other code complexities you have going on.Anther reason for choosing Jekyll for me was their incremental build feature. This means that instead of rebuilding the entire site, Jekyll rebuilds only the files that changed. That is, instead of completely blowing away and rebuilding the whole site from scratch each time, Jekyll regenerates just the part that changed.  StaticGen maintains a list of the most common static site generatorsTo sum up the advantages of static site generators  Speed: As there are no database queries to run, no templating and no processing whatsoever on every request, the content is served very fast  Content Version Control: In a static site, the content is typically stored in flat files and treated as any other component of the codebase  Security: Static sites keep it simple, since there’s not much to mess up when there’s only a web server serving plain HTML pages  Ease-of-use: The site generation process, that can be done from an environment that you control locally and not necessarily on the web server that will run the site which means that there is very little hassle to set up the server and maintain it  Scalability: A static site is generally better prepared for unexpected traffic peaks, as serving static HTML pages consumes a very small amount of server resourcesJekyll uses the Liquid templates to process and render HTML. There are two important things to know about using Liquid.First, a YAML front-matter block is at the beginning of every content file. It specifies the layout of the page and other variables, like title, date and tags. It may include custom page variables that you’ve created, too.Liquid template tags are used to execute loops and conditional statements and to output content.Setting up the environmentJekyll is a command-line executable built with Ruby and has a few commands we need to run from time to time. Ruby comes installed by default on various operating systems, the latest stable version is 2.3.1, but anything above 2.2 should be fine. If you need to upgrade, we recommend using something like rbenv to make it easy.You can then install Jekyll easily by executing:gem install jekyll -v 3.1.6Now, creating a new Jekyll site is as easy as:jekyll new awesome-blogThe new command here will create an install of Jekyll with the default theme.Jekyll comes with a built-in development server. jekyll serve command start this server on your machine and starts watching your files for changes similar to Grunt or Gulp.For more detailed instructions about setting about Jekyll sites, i recommend reading:  Getting Started with JekyllMake a Static Website with Jekyll  Building a Jekyll Site: Converting a Static Website To Jekyll  Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages  jekyll-now - Build a Jekyll blog in minutes, without touching the command lineDirectory StructureJekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the system is this: you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files.  You can refer to Jekyll docs documentation for more detailed descriptions about the files and folders structure  _data: In addition to the built-in variables in the main config, you can specify your own custom data that can be accessed from here  _includes: Snippets of code that can be used throughout your templates  _layouts: The main layouts defined for various pages and posts  _pages: Any special pages that are not of type posts  _drafts: This folder actually isn’t there if your using the default theme.

This is used in the post header to create the “contribute to this post” link.  background.default-post: This is the default image used in the generation of the post preview if there was no image post defined.  permalink: This defines the structure of the URL for the posts  sass: Defines the location of the preprocessing files  google-analytics: This is the Google Analytics tracking information that will be picked up by the _includes/scripts.html to inject the Google Analytics script.  featured: This is an initialization of an empty array that will be used to save featured articles  disquss.shortname: This is Disquss website shortname which is used to inject _includes/partials/post/comments.htmlPosts &amp;amp; PagesThere are two main types of web pages that i am using; the default post type which goes to the _posts and converts any .md file into an html page and a page which is rendered based on the templates defined in /_pages.What is notable about a page is the ability to define a permalink in the front matter e.g., permalink: /tags.html. This means that this is the page that will be access from http://ahmadassaf.com/tags. Jekyll will then look at the layout defined in the front matter and render the correct file from _layouts.Collaborating on PostsSince one of the reasons i moved to Jekyll and markdown-based blog is to enable people to contribute to my posts. To do so, i host the posts into a separate Github repository and include that as a separate git submodule by configuring the .gitmodules as follows:[submodule &quot;_posts&quot;] path = _posts url = https://github.com/ahmadassaf/blog.gitFeatured PostsIn the homepage i want always to show a set of most recent N featured posts. To do that, i have added a featured property in the front matter that will indicate if this post that i want is featured or not.PaginationFor pagination i have used the jekyll-paginate gem which should be included in the _config.yml as:paginate: 7paginate_path: &quot;posts/page/:num&quot;The paginate_path is the important property that we need to take care about. It specifies the page that we want to enable pagination on. The plugin does not support pagination on tag and category pages, so as a workaround i have a new /posts route that will contain all the posts and enable pagination on them. To do so, i have created a new directory called posts in the root folder with an index.html page. This will be picked up by Jekyll and result in a /posts page. The page contains normal Liquid templates as follows:&amp;lt;div class=&quot;archive-container&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul class=&quot;archive&quot;&amp;gt; {% for post in paginator.posts %}  {% include partials/post.html %} {% endfor %} {% include partials/archive/pagination.html %} &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;You notice that the pagination is enabled by including the partial _includes/partials/archive/pagination.Categories and Tag PagesIn a fashion similar to Wordpress i wanted to have pages for my categories and tags, to do so i have used jekyll-archives gem. The plugin is enabled in the config.yml by:jekyll-archives:  enabled: - categories - tags  layouts: category: archive tag: archive  permalinks: tag: &#39;/:name/&#39; category: &#39;/:name/&#39;This is straightforward as i just specify that i want to enable them on both category and tag pages and specify the layout that will render those pages. The permalink specifies the url of the page, i have set that up to be the name of the category or the tag.  The layout specified has to be in the /_includes directory.Another special page i created is a tags archive page. This is done by creating a page in /_pages and a tags-archive template. The main code to bring all the blog tags and their posts is:{% capture site_tags %}{% for tag in site.tags %}{{ tag | first }}{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}{% endfor %}{% endcapture %}{% assign tags = site_tags | split:&#39;,&#39; | sort %}{% for item in (0..site.tags.size) %}{% unless forloop.last %}{% capture tag %}{{ tags[item] | strip_newlines }}{% endcapture %}&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;{{ tag }}&quot; class=&quot;tag-heading&quot;&amp;gt;{{ tag }}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&quot;archive&quot;&amp;gt; {% for post in site.tags[tag] %}{% if post.title != null %}  {% include partials/post.html %} {% endif %}{% endfor %}  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;{% endunless %}{% endfor %}Data FilesAs explained in the directory structure, the _data folder is where you can store additional data for Jekyll to use when generating your site. These files must be YAML, JSON, or CSV files (using either the .yml, .yaml, .json or .csv extension), and they will be accessible via site.data.Extra FeaturesThere are various features powered by a set of JavaScript plugins and functions. These are mainly:  Responsive videos using FitVids  Image Gallery using Magnific Popup  Embedding Github Gists using gist Embedding Tweets by simply pasting the url of a tweet e.g., https://twitter.com/SpatialRed/status/778274886561193984 into the post. The url will be picked up by jekyll-lazy-tweet-embedding plugin and rendered properly  Embedding YouTube videos with youtube {youtube-video-id} where you pass the id of the YouTube video using this gist  Embedding Vimeo videos with vimeo {vimeo-video-id} where you pass the id of the Vimeo video using jekyll-vimeo-plugin  Open Graph, Twitter and Schema.or annotation enabled  Image compression using grunt-contrib-imageminDynamic Navigation MenuI wanted to have a navigation menu that is dynamic and shows automatically all the categories i have configured in the posts front matter. To do that, i use the following:{% capture site_categories %}{% for category in site.categories %}{{ category | first }}{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}{% endfor %}{% endcapture %}{% assign categories = site_categories | split:&#39;,&#39; | uniq %}{% for item in (0..categories.size) %}{% unless forloop.last %}{% capture category %}{{ categories[item] | strip_newlines }}{% endcapture %}&amp;lt;li {% if page.title == category or page.category == category %} class=&quot;current&quot; {% endif %}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.url }}/{{ category | downcase | replace:&#39; &#39;, &#39;-&#39;}}&quot;&amp;gt;{{ category }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;{% endunless %}{% endfor %}  As you see that i transfer the name of the category to lower case and replace any space with - to match the permalink generated by Jekyll.Image GalleryTo utilize the image gallery we need to provide a simple markup{% capture images %} /images/posts/quora-better-notification.png{% endcapture %}{% include partials/post/gallery.html images=images caption=&quot;Quora Better Notifications (QBN) Chrome Extension&quot; cols=1 %}note that the directory we referring to is /images/posts. This is the directory that we will copy all the posts images to using our grunt build script. Also you can pass multiple images in between the captureThere are also few CSS classes to display images side-by-side like:&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://placehold.it/1200x600.JPG&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpeg&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;Two images.&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;third&quot;&amp;gt;.....&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;In addition, there are various CSS classes for image alignment. They are:# The image blow happens to be **centered**.![image-center](http://lorempixel.com/580/300){: .align-center}# The image blow happens to be **left aligned**.![image-left](http://lorempixel.com/150/150){: .align-left}# The image blow happens to be **right aligned**.![image-right](http://lorempixel.com/300/200){: .align-right}HTML Tags and Formatting  Subscript Tag: Getting our science styling on with H&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;O, which should push the “2” down.  Superscript Tag: Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton’s E = MC&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, which should lift the 2 up.  Keyboard Tag: This scarcely known tag emulates &amp;lt;kbd&amp;gt;keyboard text&amp;lt;/kbd&amp;gt;, which is usually styled like the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; tag.  Abbreviation Tag: Doing *[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets will result in: The abbreviation CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets”.  Notices: You can also add notices by appending {: .notice} to a paragraph.There are also a variety of button styles that can be used as follows:[Primary Button Text](#link){: .btn}[Success Button Text](#link){: .btn .btn_success}[Warning Button Text](#link){: .btn .btn_warning}[Danger Button Text](#link){: .btn .btn_danger}[Info Button Text](#link){: .btn .btn_info}A notice displays information that explains nearby content. Often used to call attention to a particular detail.When using Kramdown {: .notice} can be added after a sentence to assign the .notice to the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; element. There are the following notices types:{: .notice}{: .notice_info}{: .notice_warning}{: .notice_danger}{: .notice_success}Code FormattingI use rouge syntax highlighter that comes with Jekyll. Rouge can be installed if not already via gem install rouge then enabled in configs.yml with highlighter: rouge. I am using a custom theme that is defined in /assets/_sass/_syntax.scss. For various themes and presets you can check:  Obsidian theme for rouge syntax highlighter  Darkly Pygments CSS Theme  jekyll-pygments-themesFor any of the later, you can simply copy and replace the code in /assets/_sass/_syntax.scss and you should be good to go.Enabling SearchOne thing i wanted to add is the ability to perform full text search on the posts. To do so, i first wanted to be able to grab the posts data and have them saved. I managed to o that by creating the /posts.json:[  {% for post in site.posts %}  {  &quot;{{ forloop.index }}&quot; : { &quot;id&quot; : &quot;{{ forloop.index }}&quot;, &quot;title&quot; : &quot;{{ post.title | escape }}&quot;, &quot;category&quot; : &quot;{{ post.categories | join: &#39; &#39; }}&quot;, &quot;content&quot;  : &quot;{{post.content | strip_html | strip_newlines | remove:  &quot;&quot; | escape | remove: &quot;&quot;}}&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}&quot;, &quot;date&quot;  : &quot;{{ post.date }}&quot;  }  }  {% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}  {% endfor %}]Now by requesting http://ahmadassaf.com/posts.json i am able to have a JSON file that contains the post id, title, category, url, published data and most importantly the content.Enabling full text search is done with elasticlunr by iterating the posts.json and building our index// This will include the posts.json built in the _site by jekyllvar posts= require(&#39;../../../_site/posts.json&#39;);// We would like now to fetch the posts JSON data into lunr.js and build the indexvar index = el(function () { this.addField(&#39;title&#39;, { boost: 10 }); this.addField(&#39;content&#39;, { boost: 5 }); this.addField(&#39;category&#39;);});_.each(posts, function(post){ index.addDoc(_.values(post)[0]);});Putting it all togetherTo wrap up all these features together i have created a little build script using Grunt.js. The notable build actions are:  Cleaning up working directories (the images folder and the built JavaScript destination)  Create the images directory that we will copy the posts images into as well as the JavaScript build destination directory  Copy the images from the posts directory into the main images folderNow, i would like to easily be able deploy my application on my live server as well as being able to run and test it in my local machine. The main thing to note here is that we need to have the url pointing to two different URIs on each machine. To do this dynamically, i created a new _config.dev.yml file that will overwrite only the url setting to run on localhost:4000 and kept the url in my main _config.yml to my live server address.Now, after doing that to serve the site locally i pass in the --config flag with the two config files, with the overriding config last as: bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml  note that the --incremental is a defualt optional flag to optimize the build and serve process by rebuilding changed files only and not the whole siteUsing Jekyll, Grunt and BrowserifyI use Browserify in my main.js to easily bundle up all of my front-end dependencies. Now, if i am serving my site and want to test my JavaScript changes, it is painful to build everytime the site for that. The jekyll watch feature will not run browserify for me, so instead i use the grunt-concurrent with a watch task defined to monitor and fire a browserify build whenever a change is detected and a background shell process using grunt-bg-shell to serve. The all come together like:clean: [&#39;assets/js/build/&#39;],mkdir: { images: {  options: { create: [&#39;images/posts&#39;] }}, js: {  options: { create: [&#39;assets/js/build&#39;] } }},copy: { images: {  files: [{expand: true,cwd: &#39;_posts/images&#39;,src: [&#39;**&#39;],dest: &#39;images/posts/&#39;  }] }},imagemin: { dynamic: {files: [{  expand: true,  cwd: &#39;images/posts/&#39;,  src: [&#39;**/*.{png,jpg,gif}&#39;],  dest: &#39;images/posts/&#39;}] }  },browserify: { dist: {  files: {&#39;assets/js/build/main.js&#39;: [&#39;assets/js/src/**/*.js&#39;]  },  options: {debug: true,standalone: pkg[&#39;export-symbol&#39;]  } }},minified: { files: { src: [&#39;assets/js/build/main.js&#39;], dest: &#39;_site/assets/js/build/&#39; }  },bgShell: { jekyllBuild: {  cmd: &#39;jekyll build --incremental&#39;,  done: function() {console.log(&quot;Finished Building Jekyll Site&quot;);  } }, jekyllServe: { cmd: &#39;bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental&#39; }, jekyllLocal: { cmd: &#39;bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml&#39; }},watch: { files: [&#39;assets/js/**/*.js&#39;], tasks: [&#39;copy&#39;, &#39;browserify&#39;]},concurrent: { serve: [  &#39;watch&#39;,  &#39;bgShell:jekyllServe&#39; ], local: [  &#39;watch&#39;,  &#39;bgShell:jekyllLocal&#39; ], options: {  logConcurrentOutput: true }}});In the end, i have three main grunt tasks:// Register the grunt build taskgrunt.registerTask(&#39;build&#39;, [&#39;clean&#39;, &#39;mkdir:images&#39;, &#39;mkdir:js&#39;, &#39;copy:images&#39;, &#39;bgShell:jekyllBuild&#39;, &#39;browserify&#39;, &#39;minified&#39;]);// Register the grunt serve taskgrunt.registerTask(&#39;serve&#39;, [&#39;build&#39;, &#39;minified&#39;, &#39;concurrent:serve&#39;]);// Register the grunt serve task locallygrunt.registerTask(&#39;local&#39;, [&#39;build&#39;, &#39;newer:imagemin&#39;, &#39;minified&#39;, &#39;concurrent:local&#39;]);// Register build as the default task fallbackgrunt.registerTask(&#39;default&#39;, &#39;build&#39;);Relevant References:  jekyll-now - Build a Jekyll blog in minutes, without touching the command line  Website Continuous Integration with Travis CI, Jekyll, gulp, and GitHub  Jekyll and Continuous Integration with Travis CI  Travis CI deployments to DigitalOcean  How To Set Up Apache Virtual Hosts on UbuntuNow i can run my blog locally or run it on the server as part of the CI/CD process.",url:"/posts/power-up-a-hero-blog-with-jekyll/",date:"2016-09-21 00:00:00 +0100"}},{9:{id:"9",title:"Booklight",image:"/images/posts/chrome.png",category:"projects",content:"",url:"/posts/booklight/",date:"2015-11-17 00:00:00 +0000"}},{10:{id:"10",title:"Stepping up your dev game",image:"/images/posts/mac_osx_desktop.png",category:"general",content:"In every developer time, there comes a time when he has to set-up his new working environment. For me, the transition from Windows powered PC to a Mac OSX powered laptop was one of the best things I did in my career. I found the openness of things you can do on a Unix based system accompanied with a solid appealing set of software.However, setting everything the way you want it can be time consuming, so i decided after few trials and errors to share my experience in customizing my machine and how it can be easily transferred into other machines as well.Customizing the UI MacOSX Custom layout and widgetsFirst, lets start with the light weight things. The desktop and general UI enhancement. I always love to show some nice widgets on my desktop, for that i am using Übersicht. I have used Geektool which basically allows you to run custom scripts and display them on the desktop, but i wasn’t at all happy with the experience of styling those “widgets” and the availability of 3rd party widgets.Übersicht lets you run system commands and display their output on your desktop in little containers, called widgets. Widgets are written using HTML5, which means they are:  Easy to write and customize  Can show data in tables, charts, graphs … you name it  Can react to different screen sizesThere is already a nice set of widgets published in the gallery. In my widgets folder, you will find the set of widgets i am using with customized positioning and styling.Widgets  simple-date for the date and time in the middle of the screen  prayer to show the Muslim prayer times for my area, the green indicating the current active prayer time  weather to show the nice weather forecast. It uses the Free Geo IP API to obtain your location, and the Yahoo Weather API to obtain the weather information.  System Stats disk-usage: Shows disk usage for mounted disks, with the option to exclude specific disks.network-info: Displays current Ethernet and Wi-Fi status (connected / not connected / IP Address / Mac Address.pubic_ip: Displays the current public IP address.swap-usage: Display swap file metrics for your system.top-cpu: Shows CPU usage summary.top-mem: Shows a memory usage summary.network-throughput: Shows incoming and outgoing throughput on a user-specified network interface.total-mem: Total system memory benchmarks.Installation  Installing Übersicht can be bone using the downloadable zip file or the recommended using would be via cask (which i will explain later) via brew cask install ubersicht  Installing the widgets is done by copying the contents of the widgets folder into Library -&amp;gt; Application Support -&amp;gt; Übersicht -&amp;gt; widgets. However, what i do is i setup my widgets to be in my Github repo or dropbox folder so that they are synced and can be backed up and i link the folder directly to the desired location via ln -s ~/Projects/Configurations/config/widgets/ ~/Library/Application Support/U¨bersicht/widgets where the first parameter is the location of the widgets/ folder cloned.Note I have included the folder link in my .osx file, you may need to adjust the path of the first argument.Other WidgetsOne element that i use that is not part of Übersicht is Dateline. It is a discrete desktop calendar with support to iCal and other calendar applications.GeekletsIn the geeklets/ folder there is a backup of the deprecated Geeklet scripts that i used with the old Geektool. If you still prefer it over Übersicht then feel free to use them.Dock &amp;amp; Desktop IconsIn the flat-icons you will find the set of flat icons i have used for my mounted HDD icons and the dock.To easily change application icons, i suggest you use LiteIcon which can be also installed via my caskfile.shTo further customize the dock, i use Dockmod which is the most feature-rich application for dock theming with support up to OSX Yosemite in order to provide a transparent Dock background. Dockmod can be also installed via my caskfile.I also remove the arrow icons for aliases/shortcuts which can be done automatically when executing my .osx file or manually by typing the following command in the terminal:mv /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/AliasBadgeIcon.icns /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/AliasBadgeIcon_OFF.icnsFinderAlthough i have the latest OSX Yosemite update, i am still unhappy with the capabilities of the Finder. I have found that PathFinder is a great replacement. Just head over and you can check the list of things you can do with this great piece of software.Other Tools  Flexiglass: Flexiglass features complete and convenient window management with exclusive multi-touch gestures support, offering a simple way to manage many windows on a Mac with a mouse, keyboard, trackpad, and graphics tablet. It includes different tools to move, resize, and arrange windows on the screen easily and joyfully.  Bartender: Bartender lets you organize your menu bar apps, by hiding them, rearranging them, or moving them to Bartender’s Bar. You can display the full menu bar, set options to have menu bar items show in the menu bar when they have updated, or have them always visible in Bartender’s Bar.  Alfred: Alfred saves you time when you search for files online or on your Mac. Be more productive with hotkeys, keywords and file actions at your fingertips. It is super useful with the powerpack activated with features like clipboard history. Check also this set of workflows for more integrations.  Caffeine: Caffeine is a tiny program that puts an icon in the right side of your menu bar. Click it to prevent your Mac from automatically going to sleep, dimming the screen or starting screen savers.  Flashlight: Flashlight is an unofficial Spotlight API that allows you to pro grammatically process queries and add additional results. It’s very rough right now, and a horrendous hack, but a fun proof of concept.  uBar: uBar aims at replacing the Mac Dock. It helps you find the window you’re looking for at a glance. If an application has more than one window, you’ll know right away. Click that application to open the window menu, which allows you to bring any window or even just the application itself to focus. You can turn window grouping off, and all your individual windows will be shown right in uBar.Alfred WorkflowsWorkflows are one of the key features in Alfred v2; They provide a way for you to extend Alfred to perform the tasks you need more efficiently.For example, with a workflow, you can launch a group of applications from a hotkey, create custom search filters for frequent searches or run scripts from a keyword.The Workflows i use are (Located in the workflows folder):  Fantastical: Allow for easy adding of calendar events.  Kill Process: When a process hangs, it’s a hassle to open Activity Monitor, search for it, and kill it. Once again, Alfred makes a repetitive task much faster.  Shorten URL: Shortening URLs (for tweets, emails, etc.) is a pain; you have to go to the website you want, enter your URL, wait for the transformation to occur, copy it, and move on. This allows for a quicker process across all the famous URL shorteners.  StackOverflow: Search StackOverflow questions directly.  Encode/Decode:: Encoding and decoding a string into multiple variations  Github: A bunch of Github commands integrations for Alfred.  Search Safari and Chrome Tabs: Search tabs in Safari and Chrome (also supports WebKit, Chromium, and Chrome Canary)Workflows ReferenceSetting-up the MachineDevelopers are very picky about their working environment. We may consolidate various . files tailed for our tastes over years and track the change in a version control system. It’s no secret that on the UNIX world, dotfiles play a very important part when it comes to making your terminal look good. Be it on Linux, be it on a Mac. Dotfiles are there so you can configure your favorite software to look just the way you like it.Dotfiles can be used to customize the look of the terminal, to manage bundles with Vim and saving configuration for almost anything.One thing that normally annoys me, is the fact that whenever I rebuild my machine (or build a new one) I need to copy over my dotfiles, and obviously make sure they are kept up-to-date on all my devices when I change something.My configuration consists of the following:  Mac OSX terminal with bash shell configured with a forked bash-it configurations  iTerm2 terminal with zsh shell configured with a forked oh-my-zsh configurations  A cloned gitignore repo for easy fetching of .gitignore files into various projects  A Custom set of dotfiles for various machine-wide configurationsInstallationFirst of all you will have to clone this repository into your local machine, and since there are a bunch of other git modules in this repo, you will need to recursively clone this repository and all of it children using:git clone --recursive http://github.com/ahmadassaf/ConfigurationsNote If you have cloned without –recursive, you may find out that some folders are empty. To fix this:git submodule update --initAfterwards you can launch the installation by running sh install.sh. What this will do is:  It will ask you if you would like to run an update using the update.sh script. Usually this is good when you have lots of changes in your repos and you wish to fetch all the changes afterwards, but simply skip this if this is a fresh installation.  It will install the oh-my-zsh scripts by symlinking the folder and the zshrc into the ~ folder.  It will prompt if you wish to install zsh-syntax-highlighting and does that automatically.  It will install the bash-it script files and guide throughout the installation process.  It will prompt if you would like to add the Aliases defined also to your zsh aliases recommended  It will symlink the dotfiles into your ~ folder.  It will prompt if you wish to install type-based ls  It will prompt if you wish to install grc for command output coloringIt will install homebrew and the following brew formulas: Core Modules coreutils, moreutils, findutils, binutilsBash, Bash plugins bash, bash-completion, zsh, grcDevelopment git, heroku, node, mercurial, iojsGit speific addons git-extras, hub, bfgUtilities htop-osx, id3tool, lesspipe, ssh-copy-id, the_silver_searcher, tree, fcrackzip, foremost, ack, p7zip, pigz, pv, gnu-sed, vim, wgetNetwork tools dns2tcp, knock, rename, webkit2pngDupes grep, screenIt will install cask and the following applications: Utilities path-finder, alfred, cakebrew, a-better-finder-rename, fastscripts, bettertouchtool, iterm2, launchrocket, gyazo, ubersicht, dockmod, liteicon, cleanmymac, bartender, flexiglassProductivity todoist, evernote, mendeley-desktop, fantastical, slack, screenheroDevelopment sublime-text3, atom, sourcetree, github, brackets, coda, tower, transmission-remote-gui, macvim, sqlite-database-browser, lightpaper, codebox, anvil, hex-fiend, ksdiff, codekit, MAMPInternet, Networking firefox, google-chrome, charles, dropbox, google-drive, mailbox, viber, utorrent, plex-media-serverMisc vlc, imagealpha, imageoptim, steam, the-unarchiver, spotify, handbrakeQuick Look plugins betterzipql, qlcolorcode, qlmarkdown, qlprettypatch, qlstephen, quicklook-csv, quicklook-json, quicknfo, suspicious-package, webp-quicklookColor pickers colorpicker-developer, colorpicker-skalacolo  It will aggregate the iTerm and Terminal themes as prompt you for the name of the color scheme you want to apply and apply it for you  It will prompt if you would like to run the .osx file which contains some system wide modifications and runs it for you.I recommend that you read the .osx file and enable or disable the features that you like.

Essentially, when someone says “dotfiles” they mean maintaining your command-line preferences in a Git repository (sort of like how I use Dropbox to manage my preference files for TextExpander, etc.) that you install on every computer.The name dotfiles refers to the fact that most of the files that perform this sort of configuration start with a dot. The Zsh configuration file, for example, is .zshrc The SSH configuration folder is .ssh And so on. So the concept of “dotfiles” just means “versioning your configuration files.”Your dotfiles will help you create powerful and consistent shell shortcuts and functions, settings for your editors, color coding and layouts for your shell, preferences and authentication for ssh and mysql and other protocols, and more.Warning: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!Superhero Dotfiles and Their Super PowersDotfiles are split into two main types. Those that contain a set of commands and only run once, .osx for example runs a list of commands and gives OS X super powers. Other files such as .bash_profile and .bashrc run each time you open a new Terminal session and gives your Terminal super powers.Here’s a run down of the dotfiles in my repo and a description of what they can do..bash_profile / .bashrcWhen you open a new Terminal session, this file is loaded by Bash. It loads in the other dotfiles path,bash_prompt,exports,aliases,functions,extra and configures some useful settings such as auto correcting typos when using cd completion.In some instances .bashrc can be loaded, so this file makes sure that .bash_profile is called..pathThis file speeds up the process of running executable files. Rather than having to cd back and forth across various paths to executable files, you can set the file paths in your .path dotilfe and then run executable files directly.Generally, this file isn’t held in the public repo as it can contain sensitive information.Here’s an example ~/.path file that adds ~/utils to the $PATH:export PATH=&quot;$HOME/utils:$PATH&quot;`.bash_promptUsing this file you can customise and set the various colors of your Bash prompt..exportsSets environment variables, such as setting Vim as the default editor using export EDITOR=&quot;sublime&quot; It also increases the amount of history saved, useful for backtracking over previous commands you’ve used..aliasesThis file contains useful aliases to help you write less. For example, instead of typing cd .. you can set it here to be ‘..’.

The enterprise data available for decision makers was typically relationship management or enterprise resource planning data. However social media feeds, weblogs, sensor data, or data published by governments or international organizations are nowadays becoming increasingly available.  With today’s public data sets containing billions of data items, more and more companies are looking to integrate external data with their traditional enterprise data to improve business intelligence analysis. These distributed data sources however exhibit heterogeneous data formats and terminologies and may contain noisy data. RUBIX is a novel framework that enables business users to semi-automatically perform data integration on potentially noisy tabular data. This framework offers an extension to Open Refine (Formerly Google Refine) with novel schema matching algorithms leveraging Freebase rich types. First experiments show that using Linked Data to map cell values with instances and column headers with types improves significantly the quality of the matching results and therefore should lead to more informed decisions.  The quality and amount of structured knowledge available make it now feasible for companies to mine this huge amount of public data and integrate it in their next-generation enterprise information management systems. Analyzing this new type of data within the context of existing enterprise data should bring them new or more accurate business insights and allow better recognition of sales and market opportunities. These new distributed sources however raise tremendous challenges. They have inherently different file formats, access protocols or query languages. They possess their own data model with different ways of representing and storing the data.Data across these sources may be noisy (e.g. duplicate or inconsistent), uncertain or be semantically similar yet different. Integration and provision of a unified view for these heterogeneous and complex data structures therefore require powerful tools to map and organize the data. RUBIX is a framework that enables business users to semi-automatically combine potentially noisy data residing in heterogeneous silos. Semantically related data is identified and appropriate mappings are suggested to users. On user acceptance, data is aggregated and can be visualized directly or exported to Business Intelligence reporting tools.The framework is composed of a set of extensions to Open Refine (now called Open Refine) server and a plug-in to its user interface. Open Refine was selected for its extensibility as well as good cleansing and transformation capabilities. We first map cell values with instances and column headers with types from popular data sets from the Linked Open Data Cloud. To perform the matching, we use the Auto Mapping Core (also called AMC ) that combines the results of various similarity algorithms. The novelty of our approach resides in our exploitation of Linked Data to improve the schema matching process. We developed specific algorithms on rich types from vector algebra and statistics. The AMC generates a list of high-quality mappings from these algorithms allowing better data integration. First experiments show that Linked Data increases significantly the number of mappings suggested to the user. Schemas can also be discovered if column headers are not defined and can be improved when they are not named or typed correctly. Finally, data reconciliation can be performed regardless of data source languages or ambiguity. All these enhancements allow business users to get more valuable and higher-quality data and consequently to take more informed decisions.Related WorkWhile schema matching has always been an active research area in data integration, new challenges are faced today by the increasing size, number and complexity of data sources and their distribution over the network. Data sets are not always correctly typed or labeled and that hinders the matching process. In the past, some work has tried to improve existing data schemas  but literature mainly covers automatic or semi-automatic labeling of anonymous data sets through Web extraction. Examples include that automatically labels news articles with a tree structure analysis or that defines heuristics based on distance and alignment of a data value and its label.These approaches are however restricting label candidates to Web content from which the data was extracted goes a step further by launching speculative queries to standard Web search engines to enlarge the set of potential candidate labels. More recently, applies machine learning techniques to respectively annotate table rows as entities, columns as their types and pairs of columns as relationships, referring to the YAGO ontology. The work presented aims however at leveraging such annotations to assist semantic search queries construction and not at improving schema matching. With the emergence of the Semantic Web, new work in the area has tried to exploit Linked Data repositories.The authors of present techniques to automatically infer a semantic model on tabular data by getting top candidates from Wikitology and classifying them with the Google page ranking algorithm. Since the authors’ goal is to export the resulting table data as Linked Data and not to improve schema matching, some columns can be labeled incorrectly, and acronyms and languages are not well handled. In the Helix project, a tagging mechanism is used to add semantic information on tabular data. A sample of instances values for each column is taken and a set of tags with scores are gathered from online sources such as Freebase. Tags are then correlated to infer annotations for the column. The mechanism is quite similar to ours but the resulting tags for the column are independent of the existing column name and sampling might not always provide a representative population of the instance values.PropositionOpen Refine (formerly Google Refine and Freebase Gridworks) is a tool designed to quickly and efficiently process, clean and eventually enrich large amounts of data with existing knowledge bases such as Freebase. The tool has however some limitations: it was initially designed for data cleansing on only one data set at a time, with no possibility to compose columns from different data sets. Moreover, Open Refine has some strict assumptions over the input of spreadsheets which makes it difficult to identify primitive and complex data types. The AMC is a novel framework that supports the construction and execution of new matching components or algorithms. AMC contains several matching components that can be plugged and used, like string matchers (Levenshtein, JaroWinkler … etc.), data types matchers and path matchers. It also provides a set of combination and selection algorithms to produce optimized results (weighted average, average, sigmoid … etc.).Activity FlowThe data sets to match can be contained in files (e.g. csv, Excel spreadsheets, etc.) or defined in Open Refine projects. The inputs for the match module are the source and target files and/or projects that contain the data sets.  These projects are imported into the internal data structure (called schema) of the AMC .  The AMC then uses a set of built-in algorithms to calculate similarities between the source and target schemas on an element basis, i.e. column names in the case of spreadsheets or relational databases.  The output is a set of similarities, each containing a triple consisting of source schema element, target element, and similarity between the two.  These results are presented to the user in tabular form such that s/he can check, correct, and potentially complete the mappings.  Once the user has completed the matching of columns, the merge information is sent back to Open Refine, which calls the merge module.  This module creates a new project, which contains a union of the two projects where the matched columns of the target project are appended to the corresponding source columns.  The user can then select the columns that s/he wants to merge and visualize by dragging and dropping the required columns onto the fields that represent the x and y axes.  Once the selection has been performed, the aggregation module merges the filtered columns and the result can then be visualized.As aggregation operations can quickly become complex, our default aggregation module can be replaced by more advanced analytics on tabular data.Schema MatchingSchema matching is typically used in business to business integration, metamodel matching, as well as Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes. For non-IT specialists the typical way of comparing financial data from two different years or quarters, for example, would be to copy and paste the data from one Excel spreadsheet into another one, thus creating reduncancies and potentially introducing copy-and-paste errors. By using schema matching techniques it is possible to support this process semi-automatically, i.e. to determine which columns are similar and propose them to the user for integration. This integration can then be done with appropriate business intelligence tools to provide visualizations. One of the problems in performing the integration is the quality of data. The columns may contain data that is noisy or incorrect. There may also be no column headers to provide suitable information for matching. A number of approaches exploit the similarities of headers or similarities of types of column data. We propose a new approach that exploits semantic rich typing provided by popular datasets from the Linked Data cloud.Data ReconciliationReconciliation enables entity resolution, i.e. matching cells with corresponding typed entities in case of tabular data. Open Refine already supports reconciliation with Freebase but requires confirmation from the user. For medium to large data sets, this can be very time-consuming. To reconcile data, we therefore first identify the columns that are candidates for reconciliation by skipping the columns containing numerical values or dates. We then use the Freebase search API to query for each cell of the source and target columns the list of typed entities candidates. Results are cached in order to be retrieved by our similarity algorithms.Matching Unnamed and Untyped ColumnsThe AMC has the ability to combine the results of different matching algorithms. Its default built-in matching algorithms work on column headers and produce an overall similarity score between the compared schema elements. It has been proven that combining different algorithms greatly increases the quality of matching results. However, when headers are missing or ambiguous, the AMC can only exploit domain intersection and inclusion algorithms based on column data. We have therefore implemented three new similarity algorithms that leverage the rich types retrieved from Linked Data in order to enhance the matching results of unnamed or untyped columns.Cosine SimilarityThe first algorithm that we implemented is based on vector algebra. Let (v) be the vector of ranked candidate types returned by Freebase for each cell value of a column. Then: [v:=sum^K_{i=1}{a_i}*overrightarrow{t_i}] where (a_i) is the score of the entry and (overrightarrow{t_i}) is the type returned by Freebase. The vector notation is chosen to indicate that each distinct answer determines one dimension in the space of results. Each cell value now has a weighted result set that can be used for aggregation to produce a result vector for the whole column. The column result (V) is then given by: [V:sum^n_{i=1}{v_i}] We now compare the result vector of candidate types from the source column with the result vector of candidate types from the target column. Let (W) be the result vector for the target column, then the similarity (s) between the columns pair can be calculated using the absolute value of the cosine similarity function.Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC)The second algorithm that we implemented is PPMCC, a statistical measure of the linear independence between two variables (left(x,yright)) . In our method, x is an array that represents the total scores for the source column rich types, y is an array that represents the mapped values between the source and the target columns. The values present in x but not in y are represented by zeros.Spearman’s Rank Correlation CoefficientThe last algorithm that we implemented to match unnamed and untyped columns is Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. It applies a rank transformation on the input data and computes PPMCC afterwards on the ranked data. In our experiments we used Natural Ranking with default strategies for handling ties and NaN values. The ranking algorithm is however configurable and can be enhanced by using more sophisticated measures.Handling Non-String ValuesSo far we have covered several methods to identify the similarity between “String” values, but how about other numeral values like dates, money, distance …etc. For this purpose we have implemented some basic type identifier that can recognize dates, money, numeral values, numerals used as identifiers. This will help us in better match corresponding entries. Adjusting AMC’s combination algorithms can be of great importance at this stage; for example assigning weights to different matchers and tweaking the configuration can result in more accurate results.ExperimentsWe present in this section results from experiments we conducted using the different methods described above. To appreciate the value of our approach, we have used a real life scenario that exposes common problems faced by the management in SAP. The data we have used come from two different SAP systems; the Event tracker and the Travel Expense Manager. The Event Tracker provides an overview of events (Conferences, Internal events … etc.) that SAP Research employees contribute to or host. The entries in this system contain as much information as necessary to give an overview of the activity like the Activity type and title, travel destination, travel costs divided into several sub categories (conference fees, accommodation, transportation and others), and duration related information (departure, return dates) … etc. Entries in the Event Tracker are generally entered in batches as employees fill in their planned events that they wish to attend or contribute to at the beginning of each year. Afterwards, managers according to their allocated budget can either accept or reject these planned events. On the other hand, the Travel Expense Manager contains the actual data for the successfully accepted events. This system is used by employees to enter their actual trip details in order to claim their expenses. It contains more detailed information and aggregated views of the events, such as the total cost, duration calculated in days, currency exchange rates and lots of internal system tags and Identifiers. Matching reports from these two systems is of great benefit to managers to organize and monitor their allocated budget, they mainly want to:  Find the number of the actual (accepted plans) compared with the total number of entered events.  Calculate the deviation between the estimated and actual cost of each event.However, matching from these two sources can face several difficulties that can be classified in two domains; the first is in global labels (or column headers as we are dealing with Excel like files). These problems can be summarized in:  Missing labels: Importing files into Open Refine with empty headers will result in assigning that column a dummy name by concatenating the word “column” with a number starting from 0.  Dummy labels or semantically unrelated names: This is a common problem especially from the data coming from the Travel Expense Manager. This can be applied to columns that are labeled according to the corresponding database table (i.e. lbl_dst to denote destination label). Moreover, column labels do not often convey the semantic type of the underlying data.The second domain is at cell (single entry) level; these problems can be summarized in:  Detecting different date formats: We have found out that dates field coming from the two systems have different formats, moreover; the built in type detection in Open Refine converts detected date (if found) into another third format.  Entries from different people can be made in different languages.  Entries in the two systems can be incomplete, an entry can be shortened automatically by the system; for example, selecting a country in the Travel Expense Manager will result in filling out that country code in the exported report (i.e. France = FR).  Inaccurate entries: This is one of the most common problems faced; users in the some field can enter several values that correspond to the same entity. For example, in the destination column, users can enter the country, the airport at the destination, the city or even the exact location of the event (i.e. office location).",url:"/posts/rubix/",date:"2015-04-13 00:00:00 +0100"}},{13:{id:"13",title:"Roomba - OpenData Checker",image:"/images/posts/roomba.png",category:"projects",content:"",url:"/posts/roomba/",date:"2015-02-10 00:00:00 +0000"}},{14:{id:"14",title:"Awesome Progress",image:"/images/posts/npm.png",category:"projects",content:"",url:"/posts/awesome-progress/",date:"2014-10-08 00:00:00 +0100"}},{15:{id:"15",title:"Knowledge-base Extractor",image:"/images/posts/kb.png",category:"projects",content:"",url:"/posts/kbe/",date:"2014-09-25 00:00:00 +0100"}},{16:{id:"16",title:"Quora Better Notifications",image:"/images/posts/quora.jpg",category:"projects",content:"",url:"/posts/quora-better-notifications/",date:"2014-05-01 00:00:00 +0100"}},{17:{id:"17",title:"Everything you need to know about RDF",image:"/images/posts/rdf.png",category:"Semantic Web",content:"Humans share, consume and produce knowledge using natural language; however presenting this knowledge in a machine readable and understandable format can be difficult. Lets take for example the fact that I (Ahmad) have (owner of ) a blog (http://ahmadassaf.com/blog). In natural language i can easily express that. If i want to convert this into XML which is one of the most popular data representation (markup) language, i can have the following representations:However, this doesn’t come intuitively to humans as they are used to present statements generally in a systematic fashion of Subject - Verb/Predicate/Action - Object From this thought, the idea of presenting knowledge in a three parts form was the basis of the Resource Description Framework (RDF), where i can represent the following example saying that: &amp;lt;!-- Presentation Method (1) --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blog&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;owner&amp;gt;Ahmad&amp;lt;/owner&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;address&amp;gt;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&amp;lt;/address&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blog&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- Presentation Method  (2)--&amp;gt;&amp;lt;person name=&quot;Ahmad&quot;&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;blog&amp;gt;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&amp;lt;/blog&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/person&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- Presentation Method  (3)--&amp;gt;&amp;lt;person name=&quot;Ahmad&quot; blog=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&quot; /&amp;gt;This is an intuitive knowledge representation using directed graphs, where the subjects and objects are the nodes and the predicates are the edges of that graph. This statement that comprises of these three parts is called RDF-Triple where the resource is a URI or a blank (empty) node, the property is a URI and the object can be a URI, literal or a Blank Node. If we wish to transform this knowledge into the traditional relational model (tables) it will look like:SubjectPredicateObjectAhmadhas a bloghttp://ahmadassaf.com/blogConstituents of an RDF TripleURIsA Unique referenceable URI.  A URI reference is a Unicode string that does not contain any control characters and would produce a valid URI character sequence representing an absolute URI with optional fragment identifier when subjected to the encoding that consists of:  encoding the Unicode string as UTF-8 giving a sequence of octet values.  %-escaping octets that do not correspond to permitted US-ASCII characters.LiteralsSimple Strings that describe data values that do not have a separate existence. They can be plain (simple string combined with an optional language tag) or typed (string combined with a datatype URI and an optional language tag). Typed Literals are expressed via the XML Schema data types. Whenever we are using URIs to describe things in RDF we try as much as we can to reuse existing namespaces and for literals we use the XML Schema defined in http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#.  So for example if i want to define a literal as a String i use the following syntax :&quot;Semantics&quot;^^&amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#String&amp;gt;We should note that literals are wrapped with quotations marks. The hash after the XMLSchema URI denotes the fragment identifier that points to String. In addition to these i can specify a language tag the describes the “natural” language of the text. For example, &quot;Semantic&quot;@en which means that this literal is an English world.Literals are written either using double-quotes when they do not contain linebreaks like &quot;simple literal&quot; or &quot;long literal&quot; when they may contain linebreaks. Datatypes are a bit tricky. Let’s think of the datatype for floating-point numbers. At an abstract level, the floating-point numbers themselves are different from the text we use to represent them on paper. For instance, the text “5.1” represents the number 5.1, but so does “5.1000” and “05.10”. Here there are multiple textual representations — what are called lexical representations — for the same value.A datatype tells us how to map lexical representations to values, and vice versa. RDF reuses the XML Schema (W3C)&quot; datatypes, including xsd:string, xsd:float, xsd:double, xsd:integer, and xsd:date RDF can also contain custom datatypes that (you guessed it!) are simply named with a URI. If you omit a datatype declaration it be considered as a plain literal by many RDF tools, which is not the same thing as a string. However, as of RDF 1.1 (still in development at the time of writing) this distinction is going away, so going forward you should be able to treat &quot;Rob Gonzalez&quot; and &quot;Rob Gonzalez^^xsd:string as equivalent, and many tools already do.The semantics of RDF takes language tags and datatypes into account. This means two things. First, a literal value without either a language tag or datatype is different from a literal with a language tag and is different from a literal with a datatype. These four statements say four different things and none can be inferred from the others:#ahmad foaf:name &quot;ahmad assaf&quot;                   ahmad&#39;s name is a lanaguage-less,datatype-less raw text value.#ahmad foaf:name &quot;ahmad assaf&quot;@en                ahmad&#39;s name, in English, is ahmad assaf.#ahmad foaf:name &quot;ahmed assef&quot;@fr                ahmad&#39;s name, in French, is ahmed assef.#ahmad foaf:name &quot;ahmad assaf&quot;^^xsd:string       ahmad&#39;s name is a string.So, an untyped literal with or without a language tag is not the same as a typed literal. The second part of the semantics of literals is that two typed literals that appear different may be the same if their datatype maps their lexical representations to the same value. The following statements are equivalent (at least for an RDF application that has been given the semantics of the XSD datatypes):#ahmad ex:age &quot;20&quot;^^xsd:float#ahmad ex:age &quot;20.000&quot;^^xsd:floatThese mean ahmad age is 20. That is, the textual representation of the number is besides the point and is not part of the meaning encoded by the triples. Note that if the float datatype were not specified, the triples would not be inherently equivalent, and the textual representation of the 20 would be maintained as part of the information content. Sometimes the value of a property needs to be a fragment of XML, or text that might contain XML markup. RDF/XML provides a special notation to make it easy to write literals of this kind. This is done using a third value of the rdf:parseType attribute. Giving an element the attribute rdf:parseType=&quot;Literal&quot; indicates that the contents of the element are to be interpreted as an XML fragment&amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:ID=&quot;ahmadassaf&quot;&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;foaf:name rdf:parseType=&quot;Literal&quot;&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;span xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Owner&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of this Blog &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/foaf:name&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;in Turtle notation the type used to describe XML literals is rdf:XMLLiteralBlank NodesSubjects or Objects can be modeled as blank nodes.

We should point out that we do use namespaces in order to minimize the writing that we have to do. So, if we are using many URIs repeatedly throughout our representation then its better to define some global namespace and start referring to these namespaces with a shorthand.&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;              xmlns:aa=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&quot;&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com&quot;&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;aa:hasBlog&amp;gt;               &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;/aa:hasBlog&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:RDF&amp;gt;we notice that every RDF triple is wrapped between the rdf:RDF tags. Defining namesapces is done using the xmlns (XML namespace) followed by : and the name of the namespace and then the URI. URIs are represented with the &amp;lt;rdf:description&amp;gt; tag and the URI for that RDF resource should be identified in the rdf:about attribute. In addition to that, custom properties are wrapped in tags named after the namesapce defined on top followed buy the path to the sepccific property &amp;lt;aa:hasBlog&amp;gt; We can also define more than one property for each resource:&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;              xmlns:aa=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&quot;&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com&quot; aa:hasEmail=&quot;me@ahmadassaf.com&quot; &amp;gt;          &amp;lt;aa:hasBlog rdf:resource=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&quot; /&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;aa:Name rdf:datatype=&quot;http://www.w3c.org/2001/XMLSchema#String&quot;&amp;gt;               Ahmad Assaf          &amp;lt;/aa:Name&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:RDF&amp;gt;In an RDF/XML document there are two types of XML nodes: 1) resource XML nodes and 2) property XML nodes. Resource XML nodes are the subjects and objects of statements, and they usually are rdf:Description tags that have an rdf:about attribute on them giving the URI of the resource they represent. In this example, the rdf:Description nodes are the resource nodes. Resource XML nodes contain within them property XML nodes (and nothing else). Each property XML node represents a single statement. The subject of the statement is the outer resource XML node that contains the property. We should also notice that we have used the rdf:datatype in order to specify the usage of certain types like Strings or Integers … etc. The URL can be shortcut by using namespaces as well. We have the xml:base attribute that defines a base URI that will be used globally in the XML representation. So for example, if i have identified a xml:base tag as follows:&amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;xmlns:aa=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&quot;xml:base=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/Administrators&quot;&amp;gt;and i have changed my URI from http://ahmadassaf.com to http://ahmadassaf.com/Administrators#AhmadAssaf then in the XML RDF i point out to that as:&amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;#AhmadAssaf&quot; aa:hasEmail=&quot;......&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;instead of using rdf:about and then put the hash # in front of the fragment URI, i can use the rdf:ID which has the hash tag complemented in it so that i can write:&amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:ID=&quot;AhmadAssaf&quot; aa:hasEmail=&quot;......&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;However, despite the fact that XML RDF is difficult to read and a bit expensive and not flexible, it is the standard for web documents as we can embed it simply as XML is supported by most browsers and parsers.N3 NotationSimple listing of triples. It is a shorthand non-XML serialization of RDF models designed with Human readability in mind. It is more compact than RDF XML but for complex and large models it can become very expensive.&amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#hasBlog&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&amp;gt;.N3 has some syntactic sugar that allows further abbreviations. If many statements repeat the same subject and predicate, just separate the objects with commas:&amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#hasBlog&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;http://MySecondBlog.com/&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;http://MyThirdBlog.com/&amp;gt; . And if the same subject is repeated, but with different predicates, one may use semicolons as in the example:&amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#hasBlog&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&amp;gt;; foaf:name &quot;Ahmad Assaf&quot; .Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)A simplified of the N3 notation. URIs are wrapped in angle brackets and Literals in quotations marks. Every triple ends up with a period and whitespaces or indentation will be ignored. &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#hasBlog&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&amp;gt; . We have talked about namespaces and base URIs in XML. The same concepts are transfered into the turtle notation:@prefix xsd: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&amp;gt;.@prefix aa: &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&amp;gt;.@prefix ex: &amp;lt;http://example.org/stuff/1.0/&amp;gt;.@base &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Administrators&amp;gt;so in my example i will have::AhmadAssafaa:hasBlog &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&amp;gt; ;ex:fullname &quot;Ahmad Assaf&quot;^^xsd.string .Note that we have used a semi colon to express that we want to keep stating facts about the same subject which is &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com&amp;gt; We will go to more details about this notation a bit forward. In Turtle the referring to URIs in the base ID is done in a similar way of using the rdf:ID tag as the hash is complemented with the usage of colons : and the fragment URI ex: :AhmadAssaf The current base URI may be altered in a Turtle document using the @base directive. It allows further abbreviation of URIs but is usually for simplifying the URIs in the data, where the prefix directives are for vocabularies that describe the data. For example:# Here the scope base URI is the document URI&amp;lt;a1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;b1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;c1&amp;gt; .@base &amp;lt;http://example.org/ns/&amp;gt; .# In-scope base URI is http://example.org/ns/&amp;lt;a2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://example.org/ns/b2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;c2&amp;gt; .@base &amp;lt;foo/&amp;gt; .# In-scope base URI is http://example.org/ns/foo/ at this point ...Notes  Turtle strings and URIs can use -escape sequences to represent Unicode code points (t, n, …. etc. )  Comments in Turtle take the form of #, outside a relative URI or strings, and continue to the end of line  The , symbol may be used to repeat the subject and predicate of triples that only differ in the object RDF term.# this is not a complete turtle document:a :b :c ,:d .# the last triple is :a :b :d .  The ; symbol may be used to repeat the subject of of triples that vary only in predicate and object RDF terms.# this is not a complete turtle document:a :b :c ;:d :e .# the last triple is :a :d :e .The Framework is a combination of web based protocols (URI, HTTP, XML … etc.) that are based on formal models and defines all the allowed relationships among resources.Blank Nodes (B Nodes )We have talked earlier about Blank Nodes or B Nodes. They are basically nodes that might not have names and are potentially un-referenceable. RDF only allows binary relations, so it’s necessary to express many-way relations using intermediate nodes, and these nodes are often anonymous.They are used usually to express collections, for example if i want to say that my blog is influenced by other resources, in natural language i can say that my blog at http://ahmadassaf.com/blog is influenced by Blog A at http://www.BlogA.com and Blog B at http://www.BlogB.com If i want to represent this as a directed graph i will do: The problem now is that how can i distinguish between these two sources ?! which URL corresponds to which resources name ?! so now we have to think of a workaround to ensure unique representation and selection of resources. We can make this happen (representing multi valued relation) by introducing additional nodes in the graph: The nodes in black are blank nodes that do not have a name and only act as a connection point ( A visual representation): Now how can we represent Blank Nodes in XML RDF and Turtle notation ?!&amp;lt;?xml version-&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;              xmlns:aa=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&quot; aa:hasName=&quot;Ahmad Assaf&#39;s Blog&quot; &amp;gt;     &amp;lt;aa:isInfluencedBy rdf:parseType=&quot;Resource&quot;/&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;aa:name&amp;gt;Blog A&amp;lt;/aa:name&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;aa:link&amp;gt;http://www.blogA.com&amp;lt;/aa:link&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/aa:isInfluencedBy&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:RDF&amp;gt;In XML RDF the blank nodes are denoted by the rdf:parseType=&quot;Resource&quot;, in Turtle its much more easier:@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .@prefix aa: &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&amp;gt; .&amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&amp;gt; aa:isInfluencedBy [     aa:name &quot;Blog A&quot; ;     aa:link &quot;http://www.blogA.com&quot; ].we simply introduce blank nodes in Turtle by using the brackets [ ]. So far we have known that Blank Nodes do not have name, this is not always the case as sometime i need to give a label or a name to that blank node in order to be able to reference it locally. In this example the nodeID will follow the default base URI.&amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&quot; aa:hasName=&quot;Ahmad Assaf&#39;s Blog&quot;&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;aa:isInfluencedBy rdf:nodeID=&quot;Resouce1 /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:nodeID=&quot;Resource1&quot;&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;aa:name&amp;gt;Blog A&amp;lt;/aa:name&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;aa:link&amp;gt;http://www.blogA.com&amp;lt;/aa:link&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;In Turtle we use the underscore _ followed by a colon that denotes the default namespace and then the Blank Node name@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .@prefix aa: &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&amp;gt; .&amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&amp;gt; aa:isInfluencedBy  _:Resource1 ._:Resource1 aa:name &quot;Blog A&quot; ;                aa:link &quot;http://www.blogA.com&quot; .so Blank Nodes do NOT need be de-referencable and accessed from the outside world, however they can have IDs or names that will them to be referenced in an RDF document or model.Data Structures in RDFIn RDF there exists some kind of collections (in computer science terms) that will allow us aggregate nodes or facts together. They are general data structures to enumerate any resource or literal. They are basically a syntactic sugar that will ease the process of writing code with no semantic expressiveness whatsoever. We have in RDF two different aggregators:ContainersAn open list of elements possibly including duplicate members where new entries (additions) are possible Note that the container resource (which may either be a blank node or a resource with a URIref) denotes the group as a whole. The members of the container can be described by defining a container membership property for each member with the container resource as its subject and the member as its object. These container membership properties have names of the form rdf:_n where n is a decimal integer greater than zero, with no leading zeros, e.g., rdf:_1, rdf:_2, rdf:_3 and so on, and are used specifically for describing the members of containers. Container resources may also have other properties that describe the container, in addition to the container membership properties and the rdf:type property. We notice that collection node has a type of rdf:type rdf:seq which means that this is a sequential collection or list and the order of the items is important. Each item in the list have a unique property rdf:_1, rdf:_2 ... etc. In Turtle, sequential collections are represented as:@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .@prefix aa: &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&amp;gt; .@base &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/&amp;gt;:blog aa:hasAdmins [     a rdf:Seq;     rdf:_1 &amp;lt;A&amp;gt;;     rdf:_2 &amp;lt;B&amp;gt;;     rdf:_3 &amp;lt;C&amp;gt;.].Or it can be written as:@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .@prefix aa: &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&amp;gt; .@base &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/&amp;gt;:blog aa:hasAdmins :administrators.:administrators rdf:type rdf:Seq.:administrators rdf:_1 &amp;lt;A&amp;gt;.:administrators rdf:_2 &amp;lt;B&amp;gt;.:administrators rdf:_3 &amp;lt;C&amp;gt;.Or written as::blog aa:hasAdmins :administrators.:administrators rdf:type rdf:Seq;rdf:_1 &amp;lt;A&amp;gt;;rdf:_2 &amp;lt;B&amp;gt;;rdf:_3 &amp;lt;C&amp;gt;.In XML/RDF&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;              xmlns:aa=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;aa:hasAdmins&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;rdf:Bag&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;rdf:li rdf:resource=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/A&quot;/&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;rdf:li rdf:resource=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/B&quot;/&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;rdf:li rdf:resource=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/C&quot;/&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/rdf:Bag&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/aa:hasAdmins&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:RDF&amp;gt;RDF/XML provides rdf:li as a convenience element to avoid having to explicitly number each membership property. The numbered properties rdf:_1, rdf:_2 and so on are generated from the rdf:li elements in forming the corresponding graph. The element name rdf:li was chosen to be mnemonic with the term “list item” from HTML we notice that we referenced our blog by using the default namespace using the colon : and we have referred to the collection by the brackets [] (like Blank Nodes) but we have added the rdf:type rdf:Seq to that blank node. In RDF a short hand for the rdf:type is the letter a (like natural language in English when you say that this is a cat –&amp;gt; it means that this is sth with A type of cat ). We have known so far the Sequential container which denotes ordered list of elements, but we do also have another types of containers:  rdf:Bag  This is an unordered list of elements possibly including duplicate members and there is no given order for elements.  rdf:Alt Defines alternatives of elements and only one element of the given alternatives is relevant to the application ( a group of resources or literals that are alternatives (typically for a single value of a property) . An Alt container is intended to have at least one member, identified by the property rdf:_1. This member is intended to be considered as the default or preferred value. Other than the member identified as rdf:_1 the order of the remaining elements is not significant.CollectionsThese are closed lists where there is no extension possible. Elements of the list are already predefined. It really resembles the traditional list data structure with the fact that it is closed to insert operations. It is split recursively with Head (first) and Tail (rest), we end the list by linking to rdf:nil Each of the blank nodes forming this list structure is implicitly of type rdf:List that is, each of these nodes implicitly has an rdf:type property whose value is the predefined type rdf:List although this is not explicitly shown in the graph.@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .@prefix aa: &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&amp;gt; .@base &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/&amp;gt;:swt blog aa:hasAdmins [     rdf:first &amp;lt;A&amp;gt;; rdf:rest [          rdf:first &amp;lt;B&amp;gt;; rdf:rest [               rdf:first &amp;lt;C&amp;gt;;               rdf:rest rdf:nil .]]].However, in Turtle there are shortcuts to ease the simplify the syntax. We do that by using a new type of brackets ( )@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .@prefix aa: &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&amp;gt; .@base &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/&amp;gt;:blog aa:hasAdmins (&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; &amp;lt;B&amp;gt; &amp;lt;C&amp;gt; ) .The collection of RDF statements (RDF Triples) form together an RDF graph. The assertion of an RDF graph (assertion means that a term evaluates to true) amounts to the assertion of all triples in it, this means a conjunction (logical AND) between all the statement corresponding to all the triples in the graph.  The datastore that stores these triples is often called a triple storeRDF/XML provides a special notation to make it easy to describe collections using graphs of this form. In RDF/XML, a collection can be described by a property element that has the attribute rdf:parseType=&quot;Collection&quot;, and that contains a group of nested elements representing the members of the collection. RDF/XML provides the rdf:parseType attribute to indicate that the contents of an element are to be interpreted in a special way. In this case, the rdf:parseType=&quot;Collection&quot; attribute indicates that the enclosed elements are to be used to create the corresponding list structure in the RDF graph&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;              xmlns:aa=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&quot;&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;aa:hasAdmins rdf:parseType=&quot;collection&quot;&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/A&quot; /&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/B&quot; /&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/C&quot; /&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/aa:hasAdmins&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:RDF&amp;gt;Semantic Web practitioners found it very difficult to deal with large amounts of triples for application development. There are lots of reasons that you would want to segment different subsets of triples from each other (simplified access control, simplified updating, trust, etc.), and vanilla RDF made segmentation tedious.Named GraphsAt first the community tried using reification to solve this data segmentation problem, but today everyone has converged on using named graphs. A Named Graph is a collection of RDF statement that are given an identifier (URI). When referring to triple in a name graph we often use a 4-tuple notation (often referred to as quad) instead of the standard 3-tuple one:&amp;lt;Named Graph&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Subject&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Predicate&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;When using named graphs, TriG is the de facto serialization. It’s the same as Turtle except that statements in a single graph are grouped with {}@prefix rdf: &amp;lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&amp;gt; .@prefix aa: &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&amp;gt; .@base &amp;lt;http://ahmadassaf.com/&amp;gt;:blogGraph {     :blog aa:hasAdmins (&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; &amp;lt;B&amp;gt; &amp;lt;C&amp;gt; ) .}This trivial example puts all the statements in the document into a single named graph, egotistically called :blogGraph Again, like all things in RDF :blogGraph is a URI. Looking at the 4-tuples, it’s pretty obvious that the same statement can exist in multiple named graphs. This is by design and is a very important feature. By organizing the statement into named graphs, a Semantic Web application can implement access control, trust, data lineage, and other functionality very cleanly.RDF ReificationRDF applications sometimes need to describe other RDF statements using RDF, for instance, to record information about when statements were made, who made them, or other similar information (this is sometimes referred to as “provenance” information). Moreover, sometimes we will come across use cases where we deduce facts in our model, and the deducted facts also need to be used and modeled (become the subject of a new RDF statements). For example, if a detective (Sherlock Holmes) deduced that the gardener is the one who has killed the butler, then i might want to use this new discovered fact in a new RDF statement. This is another use case of reification.   Reification allows interleaving of RDF statements and making statements about other statementsRDF provides a built-in vocabulary intended for describing RDF statements. A description of a statement using this vocabulary is called a reification of the statement. The RDF reification vocabulary consists of the  type rdf:Statement describes an RDF statement, consisting of the following properties: rdf:subject the described resourcerdf:predicate the original propertyrdf:object the value of the property  ex:Gardener ex:hasKilled ex:Butlerex:Sherlock ex:deduces ex: ????  The use of reification makes it fairly simple to represent this information:ex:Sherlock ex:deduces ex:StatementOnGardener .ex:statementOnGardener a rdf:Statement ;    rdf:subject ex:Gardener ;    rdf:predicate ex:hasKilled ;    rdf:object ex:butler .However, while RDF provides this reification vocabulary, care is needed in using it, because it is easy to imagine that the vocabulary defines some things that are not actually defined.for example, lets take the statement::blog aa:hasAdmins :ahmadassafUsing the reification vocabulary, a reification of the statement about the blog’s administrator would be given by assigning the statement a URIref such as :triple12345 (so statements can be written describing it), and then describing the statement using the statements::triple12345 rdf:type rdf:Statement.:triple12345 rdf:subject :blog.:triple12345 rdf:predicate aa:hasAdmin.:triple12345 rdf:object :ahmadassaf. &amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;              xmlns:aa=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#&quot;              xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;              xml:base=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/triples&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&quot;&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;aa:hasAdmins&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:ID=&quot;ahmadassaf&quot; /&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;/aa:hasAdmins&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:Description&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;rdf:Statement rdf:about=&quot;#triple12345&quot;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;rdf:subject rdf:resource=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog&quot;/&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;rdf:predicate rdf:resource=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/Personal#hasAdmins&quot;/&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;rdf:object rdf:resource=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/ahmadassaf&quot; /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:creator rdf:resource=&quot;http://ahmadassaf.com/85740&quot;/&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/rdf:Statement&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rdf:RDF&amp;gt;The subject of these reification triples is a URI ref formed by concatenating the base URI of the document (given in the xml:base declaration), the character # (to indicate that what follows is a fragment identifier), and the value of the rdf:ID attribute.

It’s the de facto standard for serializing RDF with named graphs.  RDFa (RDF embedded in HTML): You can embed RDF data within normal web pages by using RDFa.  N-Triples: is a very basic RDF serialization. Its key feature is that only one triple exists per line so that it’s very quick to parse and so that Unix command-line tools can easily manipulate it. It’s also highly compressible, so large, public RDF sources like DBpedia often publish data in N-Triples form.What sets RDF apart from XML is that RDF is designed to represent knowledge in a distributed world. That RDF is designed for knowledge, and not data, means RDF is particularly concerned with meaning. Everything at all mentioned in RDF means something. It may be a reference to something in the world, like a person or movie, or it may be an abstract concept, like the state of being friends with someone else. And by putting three such entities together, the RDF standard says how to arrive at a fact. The second key aspect of RDF is that it works well for distributed information. That is, RDF applications can put together RDF files posted by different people around the Internet and easily learn from them new things that no single document asserted. It does this in two ways, first by linking documents together by the common vocabularies they use, and second by allowing any document to use any vocabulary. This allows enormous flexibility in expressing facts about a wide range of things, drawing on information from a wide range of sources.  To distinguish between URIs, namespaced names (abbreviated URIs), anonymous nodes, and literal values, I used the following common convention  Full URIs are enclosed in angle brackets.  Namespaced names are written plainly, but their colons give them away.  Anonymous nodes are written like namespaced names, but in the reserved “_” namespace with an arbitrary local name after the colon.  Literal values are enclosed in quotation marks.",url:"/posts/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rdf/",date:"2014-02-22 00:00:00 +0000"}},{18:{id:"18",title:"Cleaning up Wordpress tags",image:"/images/posts/wordpress.jpg",category:"web development",content:"During the process of designing my blog (which i considered as a learning playground mostly) i had to import/export the database multiple times, delete and review posts and do lots of changes in my posts.

The result could be seen as a worldwide, distributed file system of interconnected documents that humans can read, exchange and discuss.  Before the web, people used to write documents, cite references and then check the reference and go and look search for it, in the library or look in the library … etc.  The great invention of the web is the hyperlink; click on that link and you get to the next document in the chain .. you can easily go to the reference !! so the web 1.0 was the web of documents  Web 2.0 was application silos .. social stuff .. its not nly about the data .. by the problem is that these systems do not interoperate (update facebook profile doesnt affect you linkedin ) .. data are not linked -&amp;gt; this was not only in web but also inside enterprise data  Web 3.0 is all about connecting the data .. not the documents but the data at lower levelsIn summary, the great advantage of Web 1.0 was that it abstracted away the physical storage and networking layers involved in information exchange between two machines. This breakthrough enabled documents to appear to be directly connected to one another. Click a link and you’re there—even if that link goes to a different document on a different machine on another network on another continent! In the same way that Web 1.0 abstracted away the network and physical layers, the Semantic Web abstracts away the document and application layers involved in the exchange of information.The Semantic Web connects facts, so that rather than linking to a specific document or application, you can instead refer to a specific piece of information contained in that document or application. If that information is ever updated, you can automatically take advantage of the update. The word semantic itself implies meaning or understanding. As such, the fundamental difference between Semantic Web technologies and other technologies related to data (such as relational databases or the World Wide Web itself) is that the Semantic Web is concerned with the meaning and not the structure of data. This fundamental difference engenders a completely different outlook on how storing, querying, and displaying information might be approached. Some applications, such as those that refer to a large amount of data from many different sources, benefit enormously from this feature.  Others, such as the storage of high volumes of highly structured transactional data, do not.What is meant by “semantic” in the Semantic Web is not that computers are going to understand the meaning of anything, but that the logical pieces of meaning can be mechanically manipulated by a machine to useful ends. So now imagine a new Web where the real content can be manipulated by computers. For now, picture it as a web of databases. One “semantic” website publishes a database about a product line, with products and descriptions, while another publishes a database of product reviews. A third site for a retailer publishes a database of products in stock. What standards would make it easier to write an application to mesh distributed databases together, so that a computer could use the three data sources together to help an end-user make better purchasing decisions? Semantic Web itself does not deal with unstructured content; instead, it is about representing not only structured data and links but also the meaning of the underlying concepts and relationships There’s nothing stopping anyone from writing a program now to do those sorts of things, in just the same way that nothing stopped anyone from exchanging data before we had XML. But standards facilitate building applications, especially in a decentralized system.  From a technical point of view, the Semantic Web consists of:  Data Model : RDF (Resource Description Framework): The data modeling language for the Semantic Web. All Semantic Web information is stored and represented in the RDF. It is a flexible and abstract model meaning that there is more than one representation of RDF.  Query Language: SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language): The query language of the Semantic Web. It is specifically designed to query data across various systems.  Schema and Ontology Languages: OWL (Web Ontology Language) - RDF Schema (RDFS) The schema language, or knowledge representation (KR) language, of the Semantic Web. They enable you to define concepts composably so that these concepts can be reused as much and as often as possible. Composability means that each concept is carefully defined so that it can be selected and assembled in various combinations with other concepts as needed for many different applications and purposes.The term semantic technologies represents a fairly diverse family of technologies that have been in existence for a long time and seek to help derive meaning from information. Some examples of semantic technologies include natural language processing (NLP), data mining, artificial intelligence (AI), category tagging, and semantic search. You might think of the goal of semantic technologies as separating signal from noise. Some examples of existing semantic technologies being used today include:  Natural-language processing (NLP):  NLP technologies attempt to process unstructured text content and extract the names, dates, organizations, events, etc. that are talked about within the text. There are many extensions of NLP and they include: Search: Semantic Search often requires NLP parsing of source documents. The specific technique used is called Entity Extraction, which basically identifies proper nouns (e.g., people, places, companies) and other specific information for the purposes of searching. For example, consider the query, “Find me all documents that mention Barack Obama.” Some documents might contain “Barack Obama,” others “President Obama,” and still others “Senator Obama.” When used correctly, extractors will map all of these terms to a single concept.Auto-categorization: Imagine that you have 100,000 news articles and you want to sort them based on certain specific criteria. That would take a human ages to do, but a computer can do it very quickly.Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment Analysis measures the “sentiment” of an article, typically meaning whether the article’s tone is positive, negative, or neutral. This application of NLP technology is often used in conjunction with search, but it can also be used in other contexts, such as alerting. For example, a business owner might ask an application to “alert me when someone says something negative regarding my company on Facebook.”Summarization: Often used in conjunction with research applications, summaries of topics are created automatically so that actual people do not have to wade through a large number of long-winded articles (perhaps such as this one!).Question Answering: This is the new hot topic in NLP, as evidenced by Siri and Watson. However, long before these tools, we had Ask Jeeves (now Ask.com), and later Wolfram Alpha, which specialized in question answering. The idea here is that you can ask a computer a question and have it answer you (Star Trek-style! “Computer…”).   Data mining: Data mining technologies employ pattern-matching algorithms to tease out trends and correlations within large sets of data. Data mining can be used, for example, to identify suspicious and potentially fraudulent trading behavior in large databases of financial transactions.  Artificial intelligence or expert systems: AI or expert systems technologies use elaborate reasoning models to answer complex questions automatically. These systems often include machine-learning algorithms that can improve the system’s decision-making capabilities over time.  Classification: Classification technologies use heuristics and rules to tag data with categories to help with searching and with analyzing information.  Semantic search: Semantic search technologies allow people to locate information by concept instead of by keyword or key phrase. With semantic search, people can easily distinguish between searching for John F. Kennedy, the airport, and John F. Kennedy, the president.The main goal behind knowing these technologies is that they help us in assembling the building blocks of the Semantic Web. For example, NLP can be used to extract structured data from unstructured documents (flat files like text documents). This data is then linked via Semantic Web technologies to other published data. This bridges the gap between documents (unstructured data) and structured data.Linked DataOne of the most important movements in the Semantic Web community is Linked Data, which strives to expose and connect all of the world’s data in a readily queryable and consumable form. The goal of Linked Data is to publish structured data in such a way that it can be easily consumed and combined with other Linked Data. The Four Rules of Linked DataSo in a way, Linked Data is the Semantic Web realized via four best practice principles.  Use URIs as names for things. An example of a URI is any URL. For example: http://ahmadassaf.com is the URI that refers to Ahmad Assaf.  Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.  When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards such as RDF and SPARQL.  Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things. The Four Rules Applied  Instead of using application-specific identifiers—database keys, UUIDs, incremental numbers, etc.—you map them to a set of URIs. Each identifier must map to one single URI. For example, each row of those two tables is now uniquely identifiable using its URI.  Make your URIs dereferenceable. This means, roughly, to make them accessible via HTTP as we do for every human-readable Web page. This is a key aspect of Linked Data: every single row of our tables is now fetch able and uniquely identifiable anywhere on the Web.  Have our web server reply with some structured data when invoked. This is the Semantic Web “juicy” part. Model your data with RDF. Here is where you need to perform a paradigm shift from a relational data model to a graph one.  Once all the rows of our tables have been uniquely identified, made dereferenceable through HTTP, and described with RDF, the last step is providing links between different rows across different tables. The main aim here is to make explicit those links that were implicit before shifting to the Linked data approach.",url:"/posts/introduction-to-semantic-web/",date:"2014-01-21 00:00:00 +0000"}},{20:{id:"20",title:"Automatic Wordpress Thumbnails",image:"/images/posts/wordpress.jpg",category:"web development",content:"It happens very often that you design your WordPress theme without a need to utilize thumbnails.

You can change these parameters to include drafts, pending posts, pages and so on.&amp;lt;?php $args = array( &#39;post_type&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;post&#39;, &#39;post_status&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;publish&#39;, &#39;posts_per_page&#39; =&amp;gt; -1); $posts_array = get_posts( $args ); echo &quot; We have found &quot;. count($posts_array) . &quot; posts&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;&quot;;?&amp;gt;Now, we need to loop through all the posts and start searching&amp;lt;?phpforeach( $posts_array as $post ) {    setup_postdata($post);    ob_start();ob_end_clean();    $output = strstr($post-&amp;gt;post_content, &#39;zemanta-pixie&#39;);    $post_categories = wp_get_post_categories( $post-&amp;gt;ID );    $output =  in_category( &#39;miscellaneous&#39; ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; count($post_categories) == 1;    if ($output) {        echo &quot;We have found code in post: &quot; . $post-&amp;gt;ID . &quot; name: &quot;.       $post-&amp;gt;post_name .&quot; &amp;lt;a href=YOUR-WORDPRESS-ADDRESS/wp-admin/post.php?post=&quot; .       $post-&amp;gt;ID.&quot;&amp;amp;action=edit&#39;&amp;gt;Link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;&quot;;    }}?&amp;gt;The search part happens in the string matching, you can change the string to whatever you want to look for:```php&amp;lt;?php $output = strstr($post-&amp;gt;post_content, &#39;zemanta-pixie&#39;);?&amp;gt;You can perform a set of secondary sanity checks if you wish, i have included some just in case. For example, i am checking if the post found is not a specific category “miscellaneous” and that that the post belongs to only ONE category.&amp;lt;?php $post_categories = wp_get_post_categories( $post-&amp;gt;ID ); $output =  in_category( &#39;miscellaneous&#39; ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; count($post_categories) == 1;?&amp;gt;Finally, when we output the link you have to fill in the corresponding WordPress Installation URL so that you will be able to directly edit the post.&amp;lt;a href=YOUR-WORDPRESS-ADDRESS/wp-admin/post.php?post=&quot; . $post-&amp;gt;ID.&quot;&amp;amp;action=edit&#39;&amp;gt;Link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;Now, if you are searching for specific HTML tags in your post then you only need to change the search line to become:&amp;lt;?php$output = preg_match_all(&#39;/&amp;lt;blockquote.*&amp;gt;/&#39;, $post-&amp;gt;post_content, $matches);?&amp;gt;where we look for the existence of blockquote tags.The code&amp;lt;?php // Include Wordpress main file to be able to access WP functions include(&#39;blog/wp-load.php&#39;); // Define the scope of the search for posts, pages (published, drafts ... ) $args = array( &#39;post_type&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;post&#39;, &#39;post_status&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;publish&#39;, &#39;posts_per_page&#39; =&amp;gt; -1); $posts_array = get_posts( $args ); echo &quot; We have found &quot;. count($posts_array) . &quot; posts&quot;;// Simple counter to check the number of &quot;infected&quot; posts $count = 0; // Start the WP loop in order to check posts foreach( $posts_array as $post ) {  setup_postdata($post);  ob_start();ob_end_clean();  // Here we define the search parameters .. you can specify HTML tags here  $output = preg_match_all(&#39;/&amp;lt;blockquote.*&amp;gt;/&#39;, $post-&amp;gt;post_content, $matches);  // You can specify a set of characters or Strings here  $output = strstr($post-&amp;gt;post_content, &#39;zemanta-pixie&#39;);  $post_categories = wp_get_post_categories( $post-&amp;gt;ID );  // Another type of filtering .. checking post categories and number of posts  $output =  in_category( &#39;miscellaneous&#39; ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; count($post_categories) == 1;  if ($output) {print_r($matches);echo &quot;We have found code in post: &quot; . $post-&amp;gt;ID . &quot; name: &quot;. $post-&amp;gt;post_name .&quot; &amp;lt;a href=&#39;http://ahmadassaf.com/blog/wp-admin/post.php?post=&quot; . $post-&amp;gt;ID.&quot;&amp;amp;action=edit&#39;&amp;gt;Link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;&quot;;$count++;  } } echo &quot;Total of: &quot; . $count . &quot;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;&quot;;?&amp;gt;",url:"/posts/search-wordpress-posts/",date:"2013-10-22 00:00:00 +0100"}},{22:{id:"22",title:"How to get all the tags for a WordPress Category",image:"/images/posts/wordpress.jpg",category:"web development",content:"For various reasons, one might want to get all the categories that are assigned for the posts in a certain category. This snippet below will allow to do just that. What i did is simply putting that in the functions and then you get to call that function anywhere in the code. The parameter that you need to pass is the category ID. Please note that the table names that you have may have different prefix, the default is the wp_ and that we pull in the tags from published posts only. You can change that by changing the post status parameter. This code retrieves the tags based on the number of their occurrences in the posts in DESCENDING order.
